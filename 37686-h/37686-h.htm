<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Love of kind alone transcended Lincoln's political ambition.
His career as President, Statesman, Emancipator
is a mystery unless his preparation for leadership is demonstrated.
He was no product of sudden elevation, no creature
of opportunity. No American Statesman was better
equipped to meet a national emergency. Lincoln the plain
politician, the Illinois legislator, the congressman, and the
prairie debater, was a child of the grocery store, of the
pioneer gathering, of caucus and convention. It was this
political training that determined the mode in which he
breathed life into the momentous proclamation of the nineteenth
century. The world that admires his charity is in
equal need of his policy.</p>

<p>Until the coming of the industrial movement following
the Civil War, the Commonwealth commanded the best heart
and intelligence of the Republic. Captains of industry had
not usurped the places of power. A degraded conception of
devotion to the general welfare is in itself a sign of degeneration.
A corrupt political system is incompatible with a
healthy national existence. When individual aggrandizement
is often preferred to the common good, when private
institutions frequently allure the genius of a people, it is an
inspiration to return to a politician who in simplicity and
sincerity believed that civil service and patriotism are better
than gold. An abounding demand of the day is a practical
political philosophy.</p>

<p>In spite of golden vision, of saintly Grail, civilization still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
questions its real progress, and the sphynx of human suffering
baffles understanding. Life has ever been a ceaseless
compromise between spirit and matter, dream and reality,
shadow and substance. In the never ending conflict between
the hosts of darkness and of light, of radicalism and of conservatism,
the battle often has been won by the use of
superior strategy. Wasted energy, a lack of well directed
idealism and indifference to the laws of human progress are
the main obstacles to human advancement. There is an
ever present need of a fine sense of proportion between
vision and reality. The reformer needs more method, while
the practical representative needs more vision. The solution
of vexing governmental problems will be hastened by a
clearer and more general comprehension of the gigantic difficulties
that stand in the way of the domination of ideas
over matter. High political success comes from a profound
knowledge of the character of the hostility thwarting human
progress. Patience as well as faith must be the guide. Society
suffers from misdirected emotion on the one hand and
from impervious apathy on the other. Sensational onslaught
on evil has been often tested and its futility proved. Likewise
the common politician has made many despair of democratic
government. Abraham Lincoln represents the sanest
example of wise political action, his political life the best
platform for eternal warfare on organized evil.</p>

<p>The artist is measured not alone by his sleepless imagination
but also by the technic through which his vision assumes
external form. Dante skillfully gave voice to "ten silent
centuries." Even so the dreams of prophet and humanitarian
await the touch of the political artist to find immortality
in visible manifestation. Neither a politician without
a luminous idea nor a dreamer without political craft ever
develops into a statesman. Democracy can solve its destiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
only by an adequate appreciation of the importance of
working out its intrinsic mission. The national ideal must
become a reality. Dreamer and reformer are needed and
likewise the politician, the man of method, the student of
matter, the wielder of the tool. A heroic past will not save
a nation. "The central idea" of a people cannot be safely
relinquished, but must restlessly follow the law of practical
evolution in each generation.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln was a child of American Democracy.
He was trained in the college of republican institutions.
The danger to Democracy is the treason of her own children.
Lincoln stayed with his teachers&mdash;the plain people. He
never longed for a place they could not give nor an honor
they could not bestow. The aristocracy of externality, of
clothes, fashion, wealth, station and descent ever remained
shadows to him. He valued them at their real worth, with
finer judgment than any man in modern history. The
possibility of such a career is in itself a justification of republican
government.</p>

<p>He walked the way of the average citizen, labored in the
factory of political methods. Living in the common atmosphere,
loving the strife of debate, near to the pioneer heart
and mind, a student of popularity and party organization,
he was from the beginning a champion of the better and
broader humanity. He lived his democracy and led his people
to a higher realization of the resistless purposes of the
republic. Striking the better chords of their being, he led
them to make a mere declaration of freedom the possession
of a forgotten people. During his political pilgrimage he
ever sought to widen in a practical way the Declaration of
Independence. Many prate much of Democracy but Lincoln
dared to make it the bread of humanity.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln used political machinery for the welfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the people. He was ambitious and loved success but not
for its own sake. Station gave him wider opportunity to
practice his philosophy of life, his affection for his fellowmen,
and sympathy for the downtrodden. He is a guide to
the perplexed, to those who have not bartered their idealism
in the stifling fight. His life is richly calculated to
deepen faith in the ultimate triumph of righteousness, to
lead to the conviction that spirit and method are not sundered
of necessity, that the vision is not essentially a stranger
to the party worker, that policy and compromise have
their place in the domain of progress.</p>

<p>He looms up in American History as a politician who
glorified his craft, who kept his hands clean in all of the
sordidness of material success. Vicarious government in a
republic is ruinous. Lincoln is therefore an inspiration
for political consecration and the prophet of permanency.
He dedicated his talent to the external manifestations of
the destiny of the republic. His common sense, his practical
sagacity and knowledge of human nature and of its
limitations for progress, his prudent recognition of the
labored advance of ethical sentiment and of the solidarity
of vested interests, as well as his superb idealism and exalted
spirit may well become food and life to those who believe
in the better politics. As these become the property and
the possession of a broader community the republic will
know no fear, dissension will little disturb her serenity and
she will be equal to every emergency that may threaten her
integrity.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Abraham
Lincoln became and remained a national figure. From that
time his life belongs to the history of the United States and
has been dwelt upon with ever increasing fullness and eulogy.
By contrast his early political life has been almost forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
This work covers that neglected period, dealing with
Lincoln the politician, showing his development and his training
for national leadership. The story is largely told in
the words of Lincoln himself, stress being laid on crucial incidents
hitherto, in the main, indifferently considered. A
unity, dramatic in its simplicity, appears in his recital, giving
glimpses of a man who was guided by a supreme political
philosophy in seeking to externalize his gospel of the brotherhood
of man in statute and decision. Considerable attention
is devoted to Lincoln in Indiana and at New Salem,
showing the peculiarity of his power, his political popularity,
and the rapid maturity of his convictions as to the wisest
methods of attacking entrenched evil. An earnest, reverent
and impartial study of his political career is an enriching
education. There is no need of hiding its humble, rude
phases. The more his life is lingered over, the greater the
wonder grows at the emerging of Lincoln from the humility
and the poverty of his environment with a "message of range
and sweep," to the sons of men the world over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span></p>

<h2>LINCOLN THE POLITICIAN</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>LINCOLN IN KENTUCKY</h3>


<p>The forefathers of Abraham Lincoln, like thousands of
Western pioneers, were of a sturdy English lineage. His
immediate ancestry, however, was less distinguished than
that of many whose names are forgotten and whose influence
on American history is imperceptible. Every effort
to explain his career through an illustrious parentage has
proved altogether futile.</p>

<p>Lincoln's grandfather belonged to that band of fearless
adventurers in Kentucky, whose ideal was a lonely house in
the middle of a vast farm, even though maintained in the
presence of skulking redskins.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It was in this land that
earned the title of "the Dark and Bloody Ground," that a
common frontier tragedy made the grandmother of Lincoln
a widow. For one day while her husband was in the fields,
a short distance from the house, with their youngest son
Thomas, a sudden shot from an Indian ambush broke the
stillness of the woods and the father fell dead. The oldest
son Mordecai looking out of the loop hole in the loft of
the house saw an Indian raising his little brother from the
ground. Aiming at a silver ornament on the breast of the
redman, he brought him down. The boy ran to the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the mother opened the door. She hastened to a more
settled community where her son Thomas, the father of the
President, grew to a shiftless manhood.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of Kentucky were bred in the school of
hardship. The battle with the forest and buffalo abated, but
there remained the heroic fight with the soil. Splendid virile
qualities were born in the strife with the Indians and the
forest. Inventions were yet unknown and a living was drawn
from the earth only through grinding labor. Yet frontier
life rapidly gave way to the march of civilization, the trail
and the path to the highway.</p>

<p>Hunters and warriors became tillers of the field. The
merchant and manufacturer, the pioneer preacher, physician,
lawyer and politician appeared with the onward tide
of events.</p>

<p>The places of learning were few. Now and then a struggling
teacher gave all that he had from his humble store to
the young confidently entrusted to his care. Still something
in the little log cabin school-house, even on unfrequented
paths, developed character. Out of the battle with adverse
conditions, with few advantages and manifold difficulties,
came statesmen, and even scholars, men who laid the foundation
of states, who guided the nation through its crises, and
were equal to every emergency that endangered its vitality.</p>

<p>The law abiding character of the people was notably
evinced by the supreme patience with which they effected
their separation from the mother state, Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> With
wisdom they established courts of justice and the law of the
land was speedily enforced. A malefactor who violated the
statute against card playing, after imprisonment, turned his
back on Kentucky, swearing "that it was the meanest country
a white man ever got into."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p><p>The pioneers of Kentucky had in a high degree the instinct
of government, the passion for politics. Their sense of liberty
was tempered by devotion to constitutional principles
and reverence for the written law. The restless spirit of
adventure was tamed by the potency of political responsibilities.
At an early day, they displayed interest even in
national problems. Their views were kindred to those of
Virginia. Accustomed to restrain their own freedom, they
did not favor the coercive measures of a distant, unknown,
strong and centralized government.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The political policy
of Washington was far from popular; that of Adams was
odious.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The presidential contest between Adams and Jefferson
agitated Kentucky. Discussions were frequent and
widespread and even women participated. A pioneer boy
was so elated over the triumph of Jefferson that, sitting in
his chamber alone, he drank in cold water thirteen toasts in
celebration of the triumphant event.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that even in his infancy Lincoln listened
at the fireside to many political controversies. In that case
he heard doctrines advocated destructive of the national
sovereignty, vitally hostile to those avowed and cherished by
him in his public career. Traces of his early political surroundings
on his vital convictions are hardly discernible.
Lincoln became a national politician with little patience for
the popular doctrine of State Sovereignty. He belonged to
the Federal party by instinct. No American statesman was
broader in his outlook of the general welfare. It is worthy
of note that he passed his infancy in Kentucky; his boyhood
and minority in Indiana, and a varied career in the State
of Illinois. Not being the son of a single community or
commonwealth, he did not look to any individual state with
fullness of affection. He was a citizen of the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>As early as 1790, an effort was made in Kentucky to
promote the gradual abolition of slavery. The arrival of
Clay strengthened this movement. Strong passions were
aroused by the angry discussions that followed this futile
endeavor. About 1810 the number of slaves increased perceptibly.
The blighting effects of the institution soon began
their revelation. Labor was deemed disgraceful and demeaning.
The possession of slaves, not "high intellectual
and moral endowments," became the test of social status.
Almost everything was subordinate to the dominating institution.</p>

<p>Such, in general, was the state of society in Kentucky
when Thomas Lincoln, in 1816, made his weary trail through
tangled woodland to the wild forests of Spencer County,
Indiana. He was one of the multitude discouraged with
prospects in the Southern states. It was frequently the
overbearing conduct of slaveholders, rather than hatred to
slavery, that led the pioneer to leave the land of his nativity.
Still it is amazing that the majority of these emigrants bore
no resentment to the institution that provoked their removal,
but became or remained vigorous advocates in maintaining
its supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Efforts have been made to account for Thomas Lincoln's
movement by reason of his extreme hostility to slavery.
Lamon indulges in a more prosaic explanation, stating that
there were not more than fifty slaves in Hardin County;
that it was practically a free community; that his more fortunate
relatives in other parts of the State had no scruples
to their ownership; that he was wanderer by nature gaining
neither riches nor credit; and that a quarrel with a
neighbor, whose nose he bit off, made him more anxious than
ever to leave Kentucky.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Lincoln in his campaign biography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
remarks that this removal was partly on account of slavery,
but chiefly on account of the difficulty in land titles in
Kentucky.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Ida Tarbell even endeavors to make a sort of
Abolitionist out of Thomas Lincoln. She quotes an old
man, who claims that he was present at the wedding of
Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, and that Tom Lincoln
and Nancy and Sally Bush were steeped full of Jess Head's
notions about the wrong of slavery and the rights of man,
as explained by Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> If
this were the fact, it is very strange that Thomas Lincoln
never thereafter manifested any hatred of slavery during a
long life. If Thomas Lincoln had been a zealous advocate of
the rights of the black man, is it not stranger still that his
son never even hinted at receiving the slightest impetus to
anti-slavery opinions from his father? The long silence of
Thomas, Abraham and Sally Bush Lincoln disproves the
contention that Thomas Lincoln was a friend or champion
of the enslaved, or that his views differed from the prevailing
sentiment in regard to Abolitionism.</p>

<p>One incident looms up in the brief stay of Abraham in
Kentucky. "I had been fishing one day," said Lincoln, "and
caught a little fish which I was taking home. I met a soldier
in the road, and having always been told at home that we
must be good to the soldiers, I gave him my fish."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This
story strikingly displays the influence of his mother. Events
were few in his early life, and made a correspondingly abiding
impression.</p>

<p>Lincoln was seven years old when he passed beyond the
borders of Kentucky. There he received the rudiments of
an education from two nomadic teachers. At the time of
his departure, caste feeling was beginning to dominate society
in Kentucky, but Lincoln never showed any of its manifestations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
"He was," says Frederick Douglas, "the first
great man that I talked with in the United States freely,
who in no single instance reminded me of the difference
between himself and myself of the difference of color, and
I thought that all the more remarkable because he came
from a state where there were black laws."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>No human mind would have selected Hardin County for
the birthplace of the man who was to grapple with the most
portentous problem in all American history. For the slavery
question baffled the wisdom of the makers of the Constitution.
It darkened the last hours of the stalwart statesmen,
Webster, Clay and Calhoun. It tried and tested the
endurance of this nation in a crisis of grave moment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>LINCOLN'S ENVIRONMENT IN INDIANA</h3>


<p>The year that marked the advent of Indiana into
national statehood, witnessed the humble and unheralded
entrance of Thomas Lincoln and his family into Spencer
County. The State was a haven for the pioneer of peaceable
disposition. The danger of the Indian no longer
haunted the land. Still life was a grim struggle, hewing the
way through solid forests to reach the new home, cutting
the trees to build the log cabin, patiently raising the first
crop of corn. It took time to construct the trail and then
the road. Yet with marvelous rapidity, these early settlers
soon caused the church to appear, the schoolhouse and the
hamlet.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Party politics is largely the product of a settled community.
When men are engrossed in establishing a home
matters of national significance seem of little moment. The
kitchen is more important to the log cabin than the parlor.
So the most pressing problems of a pioneer settlement are
those of local concern. Conventions and parties were unknown
for some time. Any man could proclaim his candidacy
for office. Voters were known as "Jones-men" or
"Smith-men," after the candidate of their choice. The
earliest manifestations of party spirit arose over the slavery
question. Even under territorial government, delegates to
Congress were called "Slavery" or "Anti-Slavery." During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the canvass in which John Quincy Adams was selected as
President, the Whig and Democratic parties were little recognized
in Indiana. On election day, the workers shouted,
"Here are Jackson tickets! Here are Clay!"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The defeat
of Jackson hastened the growth of partisanship. With the
introduction of party politics came resort to trickery in
elections.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Politics was a recreation to the early settler. When the
newspaper was a luxury, when there were few forms of
amusement, it was an indulgence as well as an educational
influence to listen to the orator on the questions of the day.
Politics was the school of the nation, and in it there were
few truants.</p>

<p>The following incident illustrates a primitive political
gathering. School was dismissed at the time of the militia
election, and so the teacher took part in the festivities. A
tin cup of whiskey was passed around twice, then a two
gallon jug and bucket of water. A warm discussion arose
about Indiana accepting the land donated by Congress for
the construction of the Wabash and Erie Canals. Dr. Stone
was most noisy against accepting. "Friends of the canal
chose me," said the teacher, "to reply." "I was 'half seas
over' from free and frequent use of the cup. I was puzzled
to know what to do. Soon a fence rail was slipped into
the worn fence near by and a wash tub turned up and placed
upon it. Two or three seized hold of me and placed me on
the eminence amid shouts of the friends of the canal. I
could scarcely preserve my equilibrium. My lips refused
utterance. After a long pause, I smote my breast with my
hand, and said, 'I feel too full for utterance.' (I meant
whiskey&mdash;they, full of indignation at the Dr.'s effrontery of
opposition). The ruse worked like a charm. They shouted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
'Let him have it!' I raised my finger and pointed a moment
steadily at the Doctor. They shouted, 'Hit him again.' I
made my first speech twenty-five minutes. The Dr. talked
again thirty minutes. I closed the debate and there was a
viva voce vote in favor of the canal."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>As the early settler succeeded the hunter, agriculture became
the main means of subsistence, but it could not become
a source of profit without improved methods of transportation.
The movement for internal improvements was to have
a profound influence on the course of events in the West.
The splendid enthusiasm that lately concerned itself with a
hostile environment was now employed in competing for the
markets of the East. The Westerner was not accustomed to
wander in the realm of dreams, yet he grew romantic in contemplating
the resources of his fertile soil, and believed the
time would come when nations would pay tribute to his products.
The completion of the Erie Canal marked a distinct
epoch in this movement. It increased prices in some cases
more than two hundred per cent. This advance called for
better shipping facilities. As times became better, the people
of the West became the missionaries of the internal improvement
system.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Nothing so vividly revealed this enthusiasm as the reception
afforded Governor Clinton when he visited Ohio in 1825.
He was hailed as a hero, as a friend, as a benefactor. A contemporary
observer thus described the occasion:</p>

<p>"The grave and the gay, the man of gray hairs and the
ruddy-faced youth, matrons and maidens, and even lisping
children, joined to tell his worth, and on his virtues dwell,
to hail his approach and to welcome his arrival. Every
street, where he passed, was thronged with multitudes, and
the windows were filled with the beautiful ladies of Ohio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
waving their snowy white handkerchiefs, and casting flowers
on the pavement where he was to pass on it." The Governor
was deeply affected by such an unusual demonstration, and
even shed tears in the presence of his worshippers.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>A vast system of internal improvements in Indiana was
the fruition of a campaign of more than a decade. It was
an unfailing argument of those seeking political preferment.
The construction of roads and canals was urged as one of
the fundamental purposes of human society. This policy
was declared to be the highway from poverty to prosperity.
It fairly became the political religion of the day. Indiana,
in 1836, started with rejoicing on the path that was before
long to involve it in disasters that led it close to the chasm
of bankruptcy and repudiation.</p>

<p>Spencer County was in the southern part of the State,
bordering on the Ohio River. The country was very rough
and covered with forests, sparsely inhabited and poorly
adapted for prosperous farming. There being no market
for the products of the soil, the most primitive methods in
agriculture were in operation. Wild turkeys and deer were
had at the door of every man's cabin. Bears, wild-cats,
even panthers, were still in evidence.</p>

<p>Thomas Lincoln, though he often changed his home, did
not modify his character. He remained to the end a shiftless
man of roving disposition without effectual ambition.
A carpenter by trade, while other men built substantial
homes in the wilderness, he was content to live in a primitive
log cabin without windows, floor or furniture. It was only
the influence of his second wife that secured those urgent
improvements. A man of supreme physical strength, slow
to anger, yet dangerous when once aroused, he was not without
deep affection. Still he did not hesitate to knock his inquisitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
son off the fence for answering travelers' questions.
He was a master in the telling of stories. It was his chief
accomplishment, the main gift that his son owed to him. The
nature of his mind is somewhat shown by his rambling religious
opinions. In Kentucky he was a Free Will Baptist;
in Indiana he espoused the cause of Presbyterianism, and
in Illinois he became a Campbellite. A relative quaintly observes
that happiness was the end of life with him.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> John
Hanks, the uncle of Lincoln, was the most sturdy of his
relatives; yet, this same Hanks was so illiterate that when
Lincoln became President, he could not endow him with an
Indian Agency.</p>

<p>The somberness of Lincoln's childhood was brightened by
the memory of his mother. In intellect, she was far above
those with whom she enacted the sad and short drama of
her life. Even as a child in Kentucky he felt the spell and
potent influence of her words. When she died, young as he
was, he lived alone with his grief. The passing years hallowed
the early impression of his sorrow, yet during all these
years the memory of his mother was a mystic influence in
his development; and so when he stood almost at the summit
of his career, he declared, "All that I am, all that I hope to
be, I owe to my angel mother."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The greatness of Lincoln grows upon us when we contemplate
the conditions from which he emerged, and consider
the manner of men among whom he lived. Despite the
efforts of many biographers to brighten his early surroundings,
we have the highest evidence in his conduct and speech
that he was nurtured in hopeless adversity; in poverty that
was not alone incidental to pioneer conditions, but continued
long after it was the common fate. He comprehensively
described his environment in the statement that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
there was absolutely nothing in his associations to excite
ambition for education.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> There was little in his ancestry to
quicken his pride. He ever maintained a peculiar reticence
about his youthful days and his parentage. He may by
constant thinking have exaggerated the distressing state of
his childhood, but in the main there can be little addition
to, or modification of, his reluctant testimony.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>He made his own way in the trail of letters. He pursued
plans of educating himself infinitely better than those
followed in schools and universities. He has left us priceless
testimony of the manner of his intellectual development.
"Among my earliest recollections," said Lincoln, "I
remember how when a child, I used to get irritated when
anybody talked to me in a way I could not understand. I
do not think I ever got angry at anything else in my life;
but that always disturbed my temper and has ever since. I
can remember going to my little bedroom, after hearing the
neighbors talk of an evening with my father, and spending
no small part of the night walking up and down and trying
to make out what was the exact meaning of some of their,
to me, dark sayings. I could not sleep though I tried to,
when I got on such a hunt for an idea until I had caught it;
and when I thought I had got it, I was not satisfied until I
had repeated it over and over again; until I had put it in
language plain enough, as I thought, for any boy I knew
to comprehend. This was a kind of passion with me, and
it has stuck by me; for I am never easy now, when I am
handling a thought, till I have bounded it north and south
and bounded it east and west. But your question reminds
me of a bit of education which I am bound in honor to mention.
In the course of my law reading I constantly came
upon the word demonstrate. I thought at first that I understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
its meaning, but soon became satisfied that I did
not. I said to myself, 'What do I mean when I demonstrate
more than when I reason or prove?' I consulted Webster's
Dictionary. That told of certain proof,&mdash;proof beyond the
probability of a doubt, but I could form no sort of idea
what proof it was. I thought a great many things were
proved beyond the possibility of a doubt, without recourse
to any such reasoning as I understood demonstration to be.
I consulted all the dictionaries and books of reference I
could find, but with no better results. You might as well
have defined blue to a blind man. At last I said, 'Lincoln,
you can never make a lawyer if you do not understand
what demonstrate means;' and I left my situation in Springfield,
went home to my father's house, and stayed there until
I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at
sight. I then found out what demonstrate meant, and went
back to my law studies."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Inadequate as his education may have been objectively,
Lincoln was supremely trained in the college of lonely
thought. No American of eminence owes less to the public
school system. His entire career is a mystery unless full
value is given to the statement of Herndon that "Lincoln
read less and thought more than any other man of his
time."<a name="FNanchor_A_25" id="FNanchor_A_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_25" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>His love of learning amounted to a passion. The time his
companions squandered in recreation he largely employed in
mental improvement. His literary education was a painful
process and was gained without help. His plan was slow but
effective. "He read every book he could lay his hands on;
and, when he came across a passage that struck him, he
would write it down on boards if he had no paper. Then
he would rewrite it, look at it, repeat it. He had a copybook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a kind of scrap book, in which he put down all things,
and thus preserved them."<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>By this method he gradually evolved a style of supreme
strength and sincerity. The Bible was the main force in
its fruition. For a long time he dabbled in "crude rhymes"
and "awkward imitations of scriptural lore." With all the
gentleness of his nature, he was a master of satire, and
slowly learned to use this dangerous gift with moderation.
One of his early compositions was an impulsive effort to condemn
cruelty to the helpless toad and turtle. More ambitious
products followed. The reading of a newspaper article
on temperance induced him to contribute something on that
theme. A minister found it a place in a newspaper, to the
ecstasy of the writer for the first time tasting the sweetness
of publicity. This success led him to indulge in other
dissertations. His political environment and his readings in
American history germinated. With exultant spirit he proclaimed
that "the American Government was the best form of
government for an intelligent people; that it ought to be
kept sound, and preserved forever; that general education
should be fostered and carried all over the country; that the
Constitution should be saved, the Union perpetuated, and the
laws revered, respected, and enforced."<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This effort met
with instant approbation. A lawyer, to whose criticism it
was soberly entrusted, declared, "The world can't beat it."<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Three books had a pervasive influence upon his political
opinions, "The Revised Statutes of Indiana," Weems' "Life
of Washington," and a "History of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Lincoln has left us indisputable evidence of the profound
power of Revolutionary History in moulding his patriotic
sentiments. For in his memorable speech in the Senate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Chamber at Trenton, New Jersey, he said:</p>

<p>"May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I mention
that away back in my childhood, the earliest days of my
being able to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one
as few of the younger members have ever seen, Weems' 'Life
of Washington.' I remember all the accounts there given
of the battlefields and struggles for the liberties of the country,
and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so
deeply as the struggle here at Trenton, New Jersey. The
crossing of the river, the contest with the Hessians, the great
hardships endured at that time, all fixed themselves on my
memory, more than any single Revolutionary event; and you
all know, for you have all been boys, how these early impressions
last longer than any others. I recollect thinking
then, boy even though I was, that there must have been
something more than common that these men struggled for.
I am exceedingly anxious that that thing&mdash;that something
even more than national independence; that something that
held out a great promise to all the people of the world to
all time to come&mdash;I am exceedingly anxious that this Union,
the Constitution, and the liberties of the people shall be perpetuated
in accordance with the original idea for which that
struggle was made, and I shall be most happy indeed if I
shall be a humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty,
and of this, his almost most chosen people, for perpetuating
the object of that great struggle."<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The influence of Weems' "Life" is indicated by the fact
that Lincoln did not lose his boyish enthusiasm for the character
of Washington. He once exclaimed, "Let us believe as
in the days of our youth that Washington was spotless; it
makes human nature better to believe that one human being
was perfect: that human perfection is possible."<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
devotion is still more significant as Lincoln very rarely indulged
in hero worship.</p>

<p>We shall not at all comprehend the political life of
Abraham Lincoln unless we fairly understand the momentous
subjective influence of these few volumes. One of them, the
Revised Statutes of Indiana, contained the Declaration of
Independence. He was scarcely more than eighteen years
old when he brooded over the significance of that immortal
utterance.<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>His stepsister says, he was an indefatigable preacher.
"When father and mother would go to church, Abe would
take down the Bible, read a verse, give out a hymn, and we
would sing. Abe was about fifteen years of age. He
preached, and we would do the crying. Sometimes he would
join in the chorus of tears. One day my brother, John
Johnston, caught a land terrapin, brought it to the place
where Abe was preaching, threw it against the tree and
crushed the shell. It suffered much,&mdash;quivered all over. Abe
then preached against cruelty to animals, contending that
an ant's life was just as sweet to it as ours to us."<a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Often mounting a real tree stump his quaint stories and
impressive manner gathered all his fellow laborers. It is
related that Lincoln's father and sometimes his employers,
angered at the loss of labor, would drag the orator from
his eminence. It was about this time that Lincoln said that
his father taught him to work but never to love it.<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln's wit was no small part of his forensic eloquence.
He was more ready at the beginning of his career than in
after years to ridicule censorious conduct. So James Larkin
found it, who was a great hand to brag. He stepped up
before Abe, who was in the crowd, and boasted of his horse.
"I have got the best horse in the country," he shouted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
his young listener. "I ran him three miles in exactly three
minutes, and he never fetched a long breath."</p>

<p>"I presume," said Abe, rather dryly, "that he fetched a
good many short ones though."<a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln further found opportunity for exercising his oratorical
talent in the speaking exhibitions at Gentryville.
Public debates were no minor attraction to the community.
Discussions as to whether the Indian or negro had the
greater right to find fault with his treatment were frequent
and intense. The closing day of school was duly celebrated
by declamations, debates and dialogues. Many selections
for these occasions came from the Kentucky "Preceptor,"
rich in such utterance as Pitt's "Speech on the Slave
Trade."<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was present on one occasion at a dramatic murder
trial in which John V. Brackenridge appeared for the
defendant.<a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Lincoln heard the polished and eloquent advocate
as in a dream. After the trial the humble backwood
speaker freely praised the eloquence of the mature advocate.
Brackenridge glancing at his awkward shabby admirer
turned away without a word.</p>

<p>Lincoln learned that ability does not always go hand in
hand with sympathy. He crawled into his own world where
pride was to have no home, where humble appearances were
not to be despised. When Lincoln as President met this
same Brackenridge, he simply said, "If I could, as I then
thought, have made as good a speech as that, my soul would
have been satisfied; for it was up to that time the best speech
I had ever heard."<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The people of Gentryville were largely of a rough hardy
sort. Like other pioneers they were ready to escape the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
monotony of their life by engaging in exciting games. The
rude joke, the vulgar gibe was prized. To laugh loud was
somewhat of a luxury to the hard working settler. Refining
influence was fairly unknown.</p>

<p>However, social distinctions gradually asserted themselves
with the progress of prosperity. Parties of some pretensions
came into vogue, and distinctions were made in the
guests invited. Lincoln, who had been welcomed at the ruder
gatherings, log rollings and similar entertainments, was not
in favor with those seeking social prominence. Fond of
popular applause, he resented this treatment, and in spite
wrote satires and "chronicles," chastising the offenders.<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
These productions were coarse, vulgar and even indecent,
spiced with no lack of wit. They appealed to many, though
it is said that some were shocked.</p>

<p>On one occasion Lincoln placed certain reflections on
the Grigsby family where they could be readily discovered.
Being found, they brought on a fight for the family honor.
Lincoln had his stepbrother, Johnston, first stand "the
brunt" of the contest. A terrible fight ensued, and when
Lincoln saw that Grigsby was too much for Johnston, he
burst through the ring, caught Grigsby, and threw him off
some feet away. Then swinging a bottle of liquor over his
head swore that he was "the big buck of the lick." "If any
one doubts it," he shouted, "he has only to come on and whet
his horns." A general engagement resulted, but soon the
field was cleared and the wounded retired amid the exultant
shouts of the victors.<a name="FNanchor_39_40" id="FNanchor_39_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>From such an origin Lincoln came. Biographers seek to
illumine its poverty in vain. He was reared amid a shiftless
family. No external inducement guided him in his wearisome
journey. He was in the daily presence of vulgarity. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
alone of all his companions started in a titanic conflict with
an enslaving environment.</p>

<p>The store was the social center of the pioneer town, the
place to hear the latest gossip. There the neighbors met to
pass judgment on events of general and local interest. The
proprietor was often the only possessor of the weekly newspaper.
It was not as in later days the abode of loungers
mainly. It played a big part in the education of the frontier
community. It was the school of many men and the home
of wit and wisdom. Politics, religion and other problems
were here subjected to the scrutiny of men blest with good
sense and judgment.</p>

<p>The store drew the choice spirits in story telling, and its
hero was the man who could best kindle laughter. In a
community where this art was the highway to the general
good will, Lincoln soon became the master among the many
contestants for that distinction.</p>

<p>Wherever men congregated Lincoln sought supremacy.
Political discussions were frequent. The newcomer soon
tried his hand in the art of controversy. He gradually
gained headway in the esteem of the soberminded for the
clearness of his statements, for the keenness of his vision, and
the honesty of his manner. Day by day he gathered strength
and wisdom. It is improbable that any other young man so
soon won the general good will or was so widely respected
by all classes of men. In this, even as a youth, he was
unique. He had the splendid tact, the inherent humanity
that appealed to the various elements that constituted the
transitional frontier when it was evolving into a higher community.</p>

<p>There is very little satisfactory evidence of the political
opinions of Abraham Lincoln in Indiana. Lamon states that
his family were all Jackson Democrats; that Lincoln's employer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Jones, the grocery keeper of Gentryville, was a Jackson
Democrat, and that Lincoln read papers that championed
the principles of the Democratic party of that day,
and that he was in the beginning a follower of that eminent
political sage.<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> There is no corroboration of this testimony
that Lincoln was ever avowedly an attendant in the
school of Jackson. Lincoln frequently refers to the fact
with pride that he was an old time Whig, and it might be
inferred from his speeches and statements that he was a
devoted follower of Clay from the very first. However, Lincoln
was somewhat an admirer of Andrew Jackson. It may
be that early in life he passed through the several stages of
political development, and was thus aided in becoming a
tolerant politician.</p>

<p>From childhood until 1829, Lincoln lived in Gentryville.
In that year he made a trip by boat to New Orleans
with Allen Gentry. It was on this venture that Lincoln had
his first vital meeting with the members of the race in whose
destiny he was to be so deeply concerned. While their boat
was moored near Baton Rouge and they were fast asleep,
they were startled by footsteps on board. They knew "that
it was a gang of negroes come to rob, and perhaps to murder
them. Allen, thinking to frighten the intruders, cried
out, 'Bring the guns, Lincoln; shoot them.' Abe came without
a gun, but he fell among the negroes with a huge bludgeon,
and belabored them most cruelly," but "received a scar
which he carried with him to his grave."<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It is strange that
this incident did not jaundice the youthful Lincoln against
the unfortunate people. Though his life was endangered
by these wayward sons of Ethiopia, it did not affect his
sympathy in any degree for the burdened and oppressed
race, nor change his judgment as to the injustice of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
treatment.</p>

<p>The origin of Lincoln's anti-slavery sentiments is somewhat
of a mystery. That Stephen Douglas, reared in New
England, should become the foremost champion of the Southern
slavery policy, and that Abraham Lincoln, a son of
Kentucky, that of the bondsman, baffles the wisdom of the
historian.</p>

<p>Various efforts have been made to account for his views
on the slavery issue. The claim that he derived them from
his parents in Kentucky has been noted. Ida Tarbell enumerates
the various abolition movements in the western domain
that may have influenced him. In 1819, Charles
Osborn published a paper advocating emancipation. A few
years after Benjamin Lundy issued the <i>Genius</i> at Shelbyville.
Scarcely one hundred miles from Gentryville the <i>Abolition
Intelligencer</i> was started. There were abolition societies
in Kentucky and Illinois. The same author states that
"it is not impossible that as Frederick Douglas first realized
his own condition in reading a school speaker, the 'Columbian
Orator,' so Abraham Lincoln first felt the wrong
of slavery in reading his 'Kentucky' or 'American Preceptor.'"<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Considering the slowness of communication, the casual
appearances of even well-known journals, it is doubtful if
Lincoln heard of the abolition movement to any serious extent.
It is at least significant that Lincoln alone, of his
entire family and of his associates, saw the magnitude of the
slavery evil. Like his sympathy for the suffering animal
world, his anti-slavery sentiments baffle explanation. He
hated the infliction of wrong instinctively.</p>

<p>There is a duality to the life of Lincoln that should command
more attention. Intellectually, he lived in a world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of his own, a world in which he found little companionship.
Still he was not altogether the fruition of a subjective life.
He shared the common pioneer craving for human society.
It may have been rendered even more intense in his case
by the loneliness of his mental existence. Neither the forest,
prairie nor storm, the sunset or constellation were his friends
as men were. He loved his kind more than nature.</p>

<p>During his last years in Indiana he lived fully the life
of the people around him. Their ideals seemed his ideals.
Athletic superiority was the road to respect and honor, and
Lincoln became the foremost man in physical games. He
first won renown as a wrestler. Stories of his superior
strength were heralded far and wide and his place was unchallenged.
He was a leader in the rude crowd where might
was the test of standing. Living among men devoted to
hunting, he seldom indulged in that common recreation. In
this his individuality asserted itself. He would not sanction
suffering even in the animal world, and he seldom swerved
from his convictions even in the day when the wolf howled
at the cabin door.</p>

<p>The maturity of Lincoln's development at the time of his
departure from Indiana has not received just consideration.
Gaunt and awkward in appearance there was little in him to
attract favorable attention. He was without trade or profession.
Nothing appeared to distinguish him from the
other members of the shiftless Lincoln and Hanks family.
A stranger would hardly have chosen him as a future son of
fortune, even from that humble crowd of wanderers. Uncouth
in dress and manner, he would have found small favor
in polite society, and among those who judge by things seen
on the surface.</p>

<p>Viewed subjectively there is another Lincoln, a man of
promise and inevitable distinction. Those who have dwelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
extensively on the objective aspect of Lincoln have squandered
sympathy on his want of education. For though poor
in material things, he was rich in mental wealth, in the qualities
that make manhood, in those virtues that survive the
mutations of time, that future generations dwell on with
ever increasing fondness. At the threshold of his majority
he was already possessed of elemental ability and greatness.
He was one of those rare souls that do not lose the golden
ideals of youth with passing years. The sneers of selfish
men never changed the primal sweetness of his nature.</p>

<p>The fourteen years that Lincoln lived in Indiana were
years of splendid fruition. By his peculiar process of self-development
his mind had attained a maturity far beyond his
age. He mingled freely in the world of men and events. He
was close to the human heart, to the sorrows of the humble,
to the mute and deep emotions of the lonely dweller on the
western farms. He loved the plain people. He had the command
of style, the ease and pith of statement that schools
rarely give. Ready of speech, he could command the attention
of the rough as well as the sober minded. He was
already renowned as a dispenser of laughter through the
magic of his stories. But above all he was rarely gifted
with good sense, with a mind not easily diverted by false
lights, by the glitter of objectivity. He went irresistibly to
the root of things. A man of fine emotions, wanting in the
small social amenities, he seldom went astray in the domain
of reality.</p>

<p>It is also essential to mark the practical character of all
his learning. His knowledge was all useful and vitalizing.
His mind was not cumbered with waste materials. His education
was sound to the core, was all genuine, well calculated
for a man in the very strife of life. Judged by the standard
of schools and universities he was not an educated man, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
judged by the broader standard of thought and action he
was supremely educated, the best educated man of his time.
He served his apprenticeship in the school of experience
and only needed opportunity to be of royal service to his
fellowmen. Honest, homely and humble, he was in harmony
with the average man of his time, and was well fitted to
become a representative of the people.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE POLITICAL HERO OF NEW SALEM</h3>


<p>The immediate occasion for the departure of Thomas
Lincoln from Indiana was the visitation of the mysterious
ailment widely known as the "milk sick." The scant
progress made by the family in Spencer County strengthened
his desire to try his fortune in a new land,&mdash;a land
that in the distance held forth alluring promises of betterment.</p>

<p>They arrived in Illinois at the transitional period when
the progressive settler was putting on the clothing of civilization.
The concentration of population scattered the obstacles
of progress. The wilderness was subdued, and the
worth of the prairie land proved. The howl of the wolf ever
growing fainter and fainter marked the hurrying advance of
another dominion.<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Shyly but steadily style showed itself
in the home, food and dress. Through the surface it betokened
the coming of a settled community; it was the unfailing
external sign of prosperity and of fellowship with
religion and education.</p>

<p>The old pioneer mourned the change. He saw the loom
put away, and ribbons supplant the cotton frock. With saddened
heart, he met the new civilization. To him, it was the
doom of the old hospitality, of his freedom, the coonskin cap;
the deer shoes; the log cabin built with his own hands.
"Hog and hominy" no longer waited on hunger. What his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
child named progress did not compensate him for the flight
of the companions of his youth. The pioneer had in the
name of civilization cleared the land of the Indian, who
could not adapt himself to its way, and now the victor was
in turn to yield to the same unrelenting monarch.</p>

<p>John Hanks was the path finder for the little colony. He
selected a place close to Decatur as a home for the wanderers.
Lincoln took a hand in making the cabin which soon housed
his father and family. But rather than engage in manual
labor, he was alert to show his skill as a speaker. "After
Abe got to Decatur," says John Hanks, "or rather to
Macon (my county), a man by the name of Posey came into
our neighborhood, and made a speech; it was a bad one, and
I said Abe could beat it. I turned down a box or keg, and
Abe made his speech. The other man was a candidate. Abe
wasn't. Abe beat him to death, his subject being the navigation
of the Sangamon River. The man, after the speech
was through, took Abe aside, and asked him where he had
learned so much, and how he did so well. Abe replied, stating
his manner and method of reading, and what he had read.
The man encouraged Lincoln to persevere."<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln fretted under the tutorage of his father, and
longed for the hour of his legal freedom. When that period
came, he promptly joined John Hanks in guiding a flat boat
to New Orleans for one Denton Offutt.<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most critical incident in the life of Lincoln
was this second visit to New Orleans. Hitherto, with a single
exception, his life was simple and close to nature and the
human heart. Young as he was, the solemnity of the forest,
the expanse of the prairie, the nearness to the heart of things,
the problems of life and their seriousness already cut their
lines in his sensitive organism. Knowing little of the mercantile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
world, in the realm of thought he was already master
of those around him. There was something of Hamlet in
this gaunt youth.</p>

<p>The varied amusements of the southern city that fascinated
his companions did not move or detain him. One sight
alone riveted his attention. A mulatto girl was on sale. She
was trotted up and down like an animal. Others saw the
scene without flinching. It was nothing to them; no lash
on their backs. According to Herndon, the whole thing was
so revolting that Lincoln moved away from the scene with a
deep feeling of hate, saying to his companions, "By God,
boys, let's get away from this. If I ever get a chance to hit
that thing (meaning slavery), I'll hit it hard."<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>From that time Lincoln hated slavery with all his soul.
The slave dynasty was an organized evil of national power.
It dominated the actions and even the opinions of men; its
whisper silenced the voice of conscience; its power dictated
legislative policies, and was even known to intrude into the
sanctuary of judicial tribunals. It was not a stranger in
distinguished pulpits.</p>

<p>Lincoln was weak, helpless, unregarded. A blow from his
hand would then fall impotent and unnoticed. Three courses
of conduct confronted him. He might, with the majority
have become an apologist of slavery, as this was the popular
highway. Thus he might have gained the fame of Stephen
A. Douglas, but he would not have saved the nation. He
might have become an aggressive assailant of slavery. Such
conduct would have made him a political outcast in New
Salem. In this way, he might have won the renown of a
Wendell Phillips but he would not have become the national
helmsman. He was neither abolitionist nor apologist.</p>

<p>One other way was open. He knew his weakness. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
day to strike a blow had not yet come. He held his anger
and bided his hour. He would not rush, but await the time
when a blow from his hand would long leave its traces on
the evil. He turned back to his work and to his associates.
Objectively, he was the same as ever, but a soul had been
awakened to the crime of the ages that would not rest until
the auction block should be shattered and the American soil
rendered uneasy at the presence of the human auctioneer.
He knew that sooner or later the occasion for action would
rejoice his soul. This faith reconciled him to the sluggard
march of events.</p>

<p>Some time in the summer of 1831, there drifted into the
thriving village of New Salem one who was to add lustre to
her name. Some days later Minter Graham, the school master,
was "short of a clerk" at election. Asking a tall
stranger if he could write, he was met with the quaint reply
that he could make a few rabbit marks. "Lincoln," says the
school man, "performed the duties with great facility, much
fairness, and honesty and impartiality. This was the first
public official act of his life."<a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln first gained prestige in New Salem through his
droll stories. It was the fast road to the good will of an
audience. In those days when amusement was scant it was
no mean gift. It was then a kind of legal tender for a
dinner or similar hospitality, and in a pioneer community
popular favor is a harbinger of high honor. Lincoln found
little to do until he became the chief clerk of the presuming
store of Denton Offutt. Here he rapidly won the regard of
the listener and participated in many discussions; here he
met and talked with the people, and he made another advance
in the public esteem.</p>

<p>Like many pioneer communities New Salem was largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dominated by a rough crowd of young men, known there as
the "Clary Grove Boys." They were typical of the class in
Illinois that stubbornly yielded to the reign of the law. They
rapidly disappeared in settled communities, but in the outlying
towns, for a long time, they maintained their power.
Usually acting in unison, they were much sought by those
seeking political preferment. They attended church, heard
the sermon, wept and prayed, shouted, got up and fought an
hour, and then went back to prayer just as the spirit moved
them.<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Rude and even cruel to the traveler, they made mercy
the companion of the orphan. They had no sympathy for
weakness, or patience with culture. No stranger could attain
standing in their affection unless he proved his worth in the
gantlet of a physical contest with one of their leaders.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of Offutt for Lincoln was boundless. He
declared that, "Abe knew more than any man in the United
States," that "he would some day be President of the United
States." All this did not disturb the boys of Clary Grove,
but when he bragged "that he could, at that present moment,
outrun, whip or throw down any man in Sangamon County,"
then the pride of the gang was awakened. A bet of ten dollars
was made that Jack Armstrong, their leader, "was a
better man than Lincoln." The newcomer could not well
avoid a combat. In the presence of a host of sympathizers
of the Clary Grove leader, the fight began. Lincoln put
forth his strength and the crowd saw Armstrong's supremacy
endangered. In the heat of the fray, they forgot the rules
of fair fighting and broke through the ring. This angered
Lincoln, and with a giant's effort, he gathered their champion
in his arms and shook him like a child. Lincoln's bearing
won the regard of Armstrong. He grasped the hand
of the victor, proclaiming in the presence of his followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that Lincoln was the best fellow that ever broke into the
settlement.<a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> A wonderful friendship resulted. "Whenever
Lincoln worked Jack 'did his loafing'; and, when Lincoln
was out of work, he spent days and weeks together at Jack's
cabin, where Jack's jolly wife, 'old Hannah,' stuffed him
with bread and honey, laughed at his ugliness, and loved
him for his goodness."<a name="FNanchor_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>This was an eventful occasion in the life of Lincoln. The
humble ask little of friendship and give much. A lover of
the law, in a single hour he became the idol of the lawless
element in New Salem. From that time, they submitted to
his guidance. Respect for his strength grew into admiration
for his learning. Slowly and surely, the latest addition
to the gang tempered its harshness. As a member, he
achieved what would have been impossible as a stranger.
He loved their virtues, and was gentle with their vices. So
it was that, though he did not drink or smoke with them,
they did not think the less of him. Lincoln did not laud
his freedom from failing, so they were patient as children
with him, even in his chiding. The source of his influence
was sympathy, and not ability; solidity of character, not
brilliancy; the simple virtues, not genius.</p>

<p>Lincoln was dowered with supreme physical strength.
Rumor claimed that he could lift a load of a thousand
pounds. This renown brought him further influence with
the rougher element. He was also skilled in manual labor.
A settler relates that he was the best hand at husking corn
on the stalk that he ever saw. He grew in the estimate of
the farmers around New Salem, in a community where agriculture
was almost the sole source of wealth and prosperity.</p>

<p>Lincoln's boyish enthusiasm for athletic events was doubtless
somewhat calmed with passing years. As other interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
dawned on him he was persuaded to concern himself
with horse races and other games of chance more than his
judgment advised. An admirer states, "I got Lincoln, who
was at the race, to be a judge of the race, much against his
will, and after hard persuasion. Lincoln decided correctly;
and the other judge said 'Lincoln is the fairest man I ever
had to deal with; if Lincoln is in this country when I die, I
want him to be my administrator, for he is the only man I
ever met with that was wholly and unselfishly honest.'"<a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The steamer <i>Talisman</i> in 1832 made a trip to determine
the navigability of the Sangamon. Lincoln was selected as
helmsman from Beardstown to New Salem. The <i>Talisman</i>
on the return trip "stuck" at the mill dam. Equal to the
emergency, Lincoln "rigged up" an apparatus in the presence
of the entire assembly of New Salem. All were sure
that he had saved the steamer. The trip was of vast worth
to Lincoln. Making several speeches and shaking hands with
every one, in this one week, he learned to know more people
than he would have otherwise met in many months.<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was not only honest, but men trusted him. His
personality pervaded the community. So a biographer
states, "I once asked Rowan Herndon what induced him to
make such liberal terms in dealing with Lincoln, whom he
had known for so short a time." "I believed that he was
thoroughly honest," was the reply, "and that impression
was so strong in me that I accepted his note in payment of
the whole. He had no money, but I would have advanced
him still more if he had asked for it."<a name="FNanchor_53_54" id="FNanchor_53_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_54" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was not endowed with business skill. The only
failure he ever made in life was as a merchant. He had no
capacity for business. His partner claimed that Lincoln
could wrap himself up in a great moral question; but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in dealing with the financial and commercial interests of a
community or government he was as inadequate as he was
managing the economy of his own household, and that in
that respect alone he always regarded Mr. Lincoln as a
weak man.<a name="FNanchor_54_55" id="FNanchor_54_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln's fairness vied with his sympathy in giving him a
peculiar influence over his fellowmen. He made peace a daily
guest of the rude crowd. His method was novel in New
Salem. A stranger, angered by the abuse of Jack Armstrong,
struck him a blow that felled the giant. Lincoln
made himself the judge of the event. "Well, Jack," said he,
"what did you say to the man?" Whereupon Jack repeated
the words. "Well, Jack," replied Abe, "if you were a stranger
in a strange town, as this man is, and you were called a
d&mdash;&mdash;d liar, &amp;c., what would you do?" "Whip him, by
God!" "Then this man has done no more to you than you
would have done to him." "Well, Abe," said the honest
bruiser, "it's all right," and, taking his opponent by the
hand, forgave him heartily, and "treated." Jack always
"treated" his victim when he thought he had been too hard upon
him.<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Esteemed for his strength he was loved for his kindness.
None could resist the charm of his help to the poor and the
lowly, to the waifs of misfortune. Ab, a barefooted fellow,
was chopping wood on a wintry day to earn a dollar that he
might buy a pair of shoes. Lincoln, seeing his plight, seized
the axe, and soon the job was done. The story runs that
"Ab remembered this act with the liveliest gratitude. Once
he, being a cast-iron Democrat, determined to vote against
his party and for Mr. Lincoln; but the friends, as he afterwards
said with tears in his eyes, made him drunk, and he
had voted against Abe."<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Chandler, a poor settler, desiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to enter a small tract of land that was coveted by a rich
neighbor, started for Springfield at the same time with his
rival and on the same mission. On the way Chandler met
Lincoln. Noticing that the horse of Chandler could not
stand a forced march, Lincoln gave him his horse&mdash;fresh and
full of grit. Between the two, a friendship sprang up which
all the political discords of twenty-five years never shattered
nor strained.<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>He was active in the first debating organization of New
Salem. Those who knew him for his strength were amazed
at the logic of his statements. The president of this society
said to his wife that there was more in Abe's head than wit
and fun; that he was already a fine speaker; that he only
lacked culture to enable him to reach the high destiny in
store for him. Thereafter the president displayed a deeper
interest in his progress. During one of the debates, Lincoln
dashed into a controversy on slavery, dilating on its malignancy,
deploring the dark and hopeless state of the poor
white man. With discernment he placed his hand on the
mischief, the creation of an aristocracy in a republic; the
resulting conflict between the doctrine of the fathers and
that of the children; between the North and the South. His
discussion ranged over the consequences. He pictured the
grapple of opposing principles; a land drenched with fraternal
blood.<a name="FNanchor_58_59" id="FNanchor_58_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> A biographer is justified in contending that he
became as familiar for the goodness of his understanding as
for the muscular power of his body, and the unfailing humor
of his talk.<a name="FNanchor_59_60" id="FNanchor_59_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>With the arrival of spring in 1832, the Black Hawk War
broke out. A company was organized in Sangamon County
for immediate service. The first fruit of Lincoln's popularity
with "the boys" was his decisive election as captain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
His opponent was a man of means. The manner of election
was democratic. Lincoln and his antagonist stood some
distance apart, while the men showed their preference by
taking their place near the man of their choice. The one
with the most adherents was selected for leadership. Lincoln
made a very modest speech to his comrades, expressing
his gratification, and telling them how undeserved he thought
it was and promised that he would do the best he could to
prove himself worthy of their confidence.<a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The captain needed the mastery of his temper to control
the lawless spirit of the volunteers. Accustomed to be
cajoled in politics, they were not ready for obedience even
in the shadow of war. A story has been told that Capt.
Lincoln's first command was answered by being told to "go
to the devil."<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was jealous of the welfare of his men. Thinking
them maltreated, he told an officer of the regular army that
they were volunteers under the regulations of Illinois, and
that resistance would thereafter be made to unjust orders;
that his men must be equal in all particulars, in rations,
arms and camps, to the regular army. The officer saw that
Lincoln was right, and thereafter they were treated like the
regular army. This efficient service in behalf of the volunteers
drew officers and rank to him.<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>During the march a peaceable Indian strayed into camp
and was at the mercy of the soldiers. This old man showed
a letter from General Cass testifying to his fidelity; the
enraged men pronounced it a forgery, and rushed upon him.
The captain stepped between. "Men, this must not be done.
He must not be shot and killed by us." The passion of the
mob was stayed by this exhibition of courage, not allayed.
One bolder than his fellows cried out, "This is cowardly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
your part, Lincoln." The captain towered in lonely power.
"If any man thinks I am a coward let him test it." A new
voice was heard, "You are larger and heavier than we are."
"This you can easily guard against. Choose your weapons."
The word coward was never again coupled with his name.
"He has often declared himself, that his life and character
were both at stake, and would probably have been lost, had
he not at that supremely critical moment forgotten the
officer, and asserted the man. To have ordered the offenders
under arrest would have created a formidable mutiny; to
have tried and punished them would have been impossible.
They could scarcely be called soldiers; they were merely
armed citizens, with a nominal military organization. They
were but recently enlisted, and their term of service was
just about to expire. Had he preferred charges against
them, and offered to submit their differences to a court of
any sort, it would have been regarded as an act of personal
pusillanimity, and his efficiency would have been gone forever."<a name="FNanchor_63_64" id="FNanchor_63_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln and other volunteers arrived home just before the
State election. That New Salem should present Lincoln as
a candidate for the Legislature was the natural culmination
of his position in the community. His friends were heart
and soul in the cause. His record as a soldier increased the
interest of his companions and his associates in the election.</p>

<p>Lincoln allied himself with the Whig organization and
championed its principles. The popular party in Sangamon
County prided themselves on their devotion to Andrew Jackson.
They derisively called their opponents "Federalists,"
while the latter struggled "to shuffle off the odious name."<a name="FNanchor_64_65" id="FNanchor_64_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Lamon argues that Lincoln was a nominal Jackson man on
the ground that he received the votes of all parties at New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Salem, that he was the next year appointed postmaster by
General Jackson; that the Democrats ran him for the Legislature
two years later, and that he was elected by a larger
majority than any other candidate.<a name="FNanchor_65_66" id="FNanchor_65_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_66" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> These reasons are
without weight. Party lines at the time were not yet closely
drawn, and the supreme personal popularity of Lincoln suffered
little from the partisanship of that period. It is a
distinct mark of Lincoln's courage and his love of principle
that he devoted himself to the weaker party of Illinois.
Selfish ambition would have advised alliance with the dominant
organization. Still, the better element in Sangamon
County was largely attracted to the Whig side. Lincoln
coming from the company of the Clary Grove boys, enthusiasts
for Jackson, fearlessly decided his political relations.
National history might have been changed if Abraham Lincoln
had consulted his companions, or temporary interest in
the selection of party affiliation.</p>

<p>After his return from the war, he threw himself into the
campaign of 1832. In his first speech, just as he started,
he saw that a friend was getting worsted in a fight near by.
Hurrying from the platform, he grasped the offender and
threw him some ten feet away. He then again mounted the
eminence and delivered the following address: "Gentlemen and
Fellow Citizens, I presume you all know who I am. I am
humble Abraham Lincoln. I have been solicited by many
friends to become a candidate for the Legislature. My
politics are short and sweet, like the old woman's dance. I
am in favor of a national bank. I am in favor of the internal
improvement system and a high protective tariff. These are
my sentiments and political principles. If elected, I shall
be thankful; if not, it will be all the same."<a name="FNanchor_66_67" id="FNanchor_66_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_67" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Making a speech under such conditions was a more thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
preparation for the activities of life than the training
of schools and even universities afford its votaries. This talk
is frank and bold. It early avows sentiments hostile to the
administration in power. It reveals the "Whiggism" of the
orator. It is a product of the times; a speech to be expected
from a young speaker sensitive to his surroundings.</p>

<p>The testimony of Judge Logan shows that Lincoln had in
his youth a mature mind. "He was a very tall, gawky, and
rough looking fellow then; his pantaloons didn't meet his
shoes by six inches. But after he began speaking I became
very much interested in him. He made a very sensible speech.
His manner was very much the same as in after life; that
is, the same peculiar characteristics were apparent then,
though of course in after years he evinced more knowledge
and experience. But he had then the same novelty and the
same peculiarity in presenting his ideas. He had the same
individuality that he kept through all his life."<a name="FNanchor_67_68" id="FNanchor_67_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_68" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>A companion allows us a view of Lincoln as a politician at
this period. Deferential to the rich, agreeable to the poor,
he was at home everywhere. He talked with the husband
and wife about their hopes in life, about the school and
the farm. The mother would hear with joy of her fine children;
Willie was the image of father; Sarah the most beautiful,
and looked like her mother. The distribution of nuts
and candy captured the children. During the preparation
for supper, he would walk over the farm with his host, and be
shown its worth. After the meal he would tell the boys and
girls stories of the trials of frontier life in Indiana. He thus
secured the esteem of all.</p>

<p>Early in this campaign, he issued a political circular. This
first written address of Lincoln should command attention.
It contains abundant evidence of close thinking, political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sagacity and quaint utterance. This youthful appeal of
Lincoln is a sober production expressing thoughts that go
straight to the mind. The circular is conclusive that his
style and his thought were not altogether the fruition of his
maturity.</p>

<p>The address deals mainly with the navigability of the
Sangamon River. No theme was closer to the people in the
county. The arrival of the steamer <i>Talisman</i> had been
hailed with rapture. A newspaper thus gave utterance to
the common feeling: "We congratulate our farmers, our mechanics,
our merchants and our professional men, for the
rich harvest in prospect, and we cordially invite emigrating
citizens from other states, whether rich or poor, if so they
are industrious and honest, to come thither and partake of
the good things of Sangamon."<a name="FNanchor_68_69" id="FNanchor_68_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_69" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The enthusiasm reached
the women, for they indulged in a grand ball to honor the
occasion.<a name="FNanchor_69_70" id="FNanchor_69_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_70" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The ardent championship of this vain proposal,
for it was never either effected or seriously attempted, is
proof that Lincoln was a student of popularity. At this
period he proclaimed the doctrine that the representative of
the people should reflect the known views of his constituency.<a name="FNanchor_70_71" id="FNanchor_70_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_71" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>He next paid heed to the problem of usury. Money, always
seeking the highest bidder, preyed on the industry of
the people. The common contract rate was about fifty per
cent. In many instances it rose to more than one hundred,
and unfortunates even paid two or three times as much.<a name="FNanchor_71_72" id="FNanchor_71_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_72" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
"It seems," Lincoln said, "as though we are never to have
an end to this baneful and corroding system, acting almost
as prejudicial to the general interests of the community as
a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
each county for the benefit of a few individuals only, unless
there be a law made fixing the limits of usury. A law for
this purpose, I am of the opinion, may be made without
materially injuring any class of people. In cases of extreme
necessity, there could always be means found to cheat the
law; while in other cases it would have its intended effect. I
would favor the passage of a law on this subject which might
not be easily evaded. Let it be such that the labor and difficulty
of evading it could only be justified in cases of greatest
necessity."<a name="FNanchor_72_73" id="FNanchor_72_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_73" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This rather remarkable admission is interesting
in view of his subsequent utterances on the sacred enforcement
of all laws lest single relaxations prove an inducement
for other violation.<a name="FNanchor_73_74" id="FNanchor_73_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_74" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>A rather becoming modesty pervades the conclusion of
his address. He maintained that he might be wrong in
regard to any or all the subjects he discussed, declaring that
it was better only sometimes to be right than at all times to
be wrong, that he was ready to renounce his opinions as soon
as he discovered them to be erroneous.<a name="FNanchor_74_75" id="FNanchor_74_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_75" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>"Every man," he observed, "is said to have his peculiar
ambition. Whether it be true or not, I can say for one that
I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of
my fellow-men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem."<a name="FNanchor_75_76" id="FNanchor_75_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_76" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
This illumines our limited knowledge of his attitude
toward an essential problem of life. Lincoln did not fling
away ambition. With patient footstep he restlessly followed
the vision of higher place along the road of helpful service
to his fellow-men. As he rose in influence, he never forsook
his early ideals; that the measure of success was worthiness
and not station, that power was only respectable as it was
mercifully exercised. He believed that altruistic responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
expanded with growing opportunities. His good deeds,
not his personal wants, grew with his growth.</p>

<p>He did not rest with an appeal to the reason of men. He
deftly put in motion the human chord in democracy that
vibrates to the poor and the struggling. He declared that
he was young and unknown; that he was born, and would
ever remain, in the most humble walks of life; that he had no
wealthy or popular relations or friends to recommend him;
that his case was thrown exclusively upon the independent
voters of the county; and that, if elected, they would have
conferred a favor upon him, for which he would be unremitting
in his labors to compensate.<a name="FNanchor_76_77" id="FNanchor_76_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_77" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>"But, if the good people," he concluded, "in their wisdom
shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too
familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined."<a name="FNanchor_77_78" id="FNanchor_77_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_78" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Suffused with seeming humor and the pathos of half hidden
tragedy this averment brings us face to face with a life reluctantly
asserting its individuality. It is hardly strange
that one who pronounces himself a companion of many disappointments
when only twenty-three years old should soon
get the name of "Old Abe." Sorrow had already left its
traces on his heart and brain, so that the appellation was
fitting. Still, he encountered uncomplainingly the exigencies
of human events.</p>

<p>"The Democrats of New Salem worked for Lincoln out of
their personal regard for him. That was the general understanding
of the matter here at the time. In this he made
no concession of principle whatever. He was as stiff as a
man could be in his Whig doctrines. They did this for him
simply because he was popular&mdash;because he was Lincoln."<a name="FNanchor_78_79" id="FNanchor_78_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_79" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Despite the efforts of his friends in New Salem, Lincoln was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
yet too little known to be elected a representative of Sangamon
County.</p>

<p>One fact stands out boldly. Out of the total 300 votes
cast in the precinct of New Salem, where he was best known,
Lincoln received 277.<a name="FNanchor_79_80" id="FNanchor_79_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_80" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This did not pass without the scrutiny
of those who studied the details of local politics. It
revealed an amazing popularity. It was a defeat that practiced
politicians knew betokened future triumphs. It marked
the trail of a triumphing career in the common course of
events. With ardent pride, he later said of this defeat, that
it was the only time he was ever beaten on a direct vote of
the people.<a name="FNanchor_80_81" id="FNanchor_80_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_81" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>John Calhoun, a stalwart Democrat, a surveyor in Sangamon
County, and later infamous in Kansas history, needed
a deputy. He selected Lincoln, who thereupon retreated to a
farm of the schoolmaster Graham, where he studied a book
on surveying. Struggling with the task for six weeks, he
came forth prepared for his new work. He so mastered the
subject that he became renowned for the accuracy of his
measurements. "If I can be perfectly free," Lincoln is reported
to have said, "in my political action, I will take the
office, but if my sentiments or even expression of them is to
be abridged in any way I would not have it or any other
office."<a name="FNanchor_81_82" id="FNanchor_81_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_82" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This story is rather heroic. The work was of a
business character, and politics did not dictate every act of
Calhoun; he was willing to help a worthy ambitious young
man. On the other hand, the store of Lincoln had "winked
out"; he had nothing to do; he was eager to enter into an
honorable vocation without an inquisition into the motives
of Calhoun. It was a friendly act without any suggestion
of political obligation; a kindly service that cemented a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
friendship never severed, though they met as rivals on the
field of controversy. Even in the days when it was common
to blacken the name of Calhoun, Lincoln never joined in the
general hue and cry.<a name="FNanchor_82_83" id="FNanchor_82_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_83" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The acceptance of the office of postmaster at New Salem,
under the administration of General Jackson, had no particular
bearing upon the political views of Abraham Lincoln.
The office was of so little monetary importance, that Lincoln
carried its whole contents in his hat. He was the only man
of standing in the community that could afford to give it
abundant attention for the small pay. The office was doubtless
freely tendered, the more freely as Lincoln was not of a
partisan temperament. It was of value to him. It enabled
him to be of service and thus gain the good will of many.
He readily made known the contents of letters to the illiterate.
He also read aloud to the inhabitants gathered at the
store, all the news from the recent papers.<a name="FNanchor_83_84" id="FNanchor_83_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_84" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>"The first time I ever saw Abe with a law-book in his hand,"
says Squire Godbey, "he was sitting astride Jake Bale's wood
pile in New Salem. Says I, 'Abe, what are you studying?'&mdash;'Law,'
says Abe. 'Great God Almighty!' responded I."<a name="FNanchor_84_85" id="FNanchor_84_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_85" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Lincoln states in his campaign biography that one of his
fellow candidates, Major John T. Stuart, in his first canvass
encouraged him to study law, and that after election he borrowed
books of Stuart and went at it in good earnest. He
also states that he never studied with anybody.<a name="FNanchor_85_86" id="FNanchor_85_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_86" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>During his legal apprenticeship of three or four years, he
was at the call of every citizen. He wrote deeds, contracts
and other legal papers, and often appeared before the local
Justice of the Peace. All this service was free. He was
not forgotten by those he helped. Even when he moved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Springfield, his New Salem friends found that his counsel was
ever at their disposal. His door was as open to poverty as
to riches. His study of the law widened the exercise of his
sympathy and his usefulness. Then, too, every satisfied
client was likely to become a political supporter.</p>

<p>It would have been amazing if Lincoln had come short of
being the hero of New Salem. He won "golden opinions"
from every class of men. His popularity had a substantial
basis. He rode into favor on the tide of service to his fellowmen.
Wholesale dispenser of laughter and sympathy, clerk
at a store of the village, athlete of renown, arbiter of fights
and games, pilot on a memorable journey, a debater of singular
skill, an orator commanding attention, a sincere student,
a soldier of some distinction, popular postmaster, a skilled
surveyor, and later a lawyer and legislator&mdash;master in all
these relations, he proved his worth and value to the community.
No man was more thoroughly gifted in the qualities
of manhood and character that lodge in the human heart.
He took up the harp of pioneer life and smote all "the vital
chords with might." Attuned to the lowly sentiments, to the
humble ways and the hardships of the people of the prairie,
his sympathies were as broad as the plains of Sangamon
County. The drunkard, the outcast, the children and the
women, the rowdy and the ruffian, the teacher, the store keeper,
and politicians, all were his friends. He was odd in liking
so many of his kind, in the universality of his sympathies.</p>

<p>While Lincoln acted from a "full warm heart," policy
could not have dictated wiser conduct for a political career.
Could genius have planned the course, it would not have
added greater skill to its success. His very faults were the
highway to public esteem. Almost every man, each woman
and child in New Salem were gladdened by his honest hand
shake, the cheer of his voice and the charm of his character.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>PRACTICAL LEGISLATOR</h3>


<p>The fame of Lincoln as a law student and lawyer, as
surveyor and postmaster, spread beyond New Salem, and
the qualities that had attracted local distinction continued
to find him admirers in a broader world. He steadily gained
headway with an ever growing audience.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Whigs gave him concerted support as one
of their candidates for the Legislature of 1834. In addition
he made large inroads into the Democratic party. Its leaders
sought to diminish the strength his name would add to
the Whig ticket by adopting him as one of their candidates.<a name="FNanchor_86_87" id="FNanchor_86_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_87" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
The flattering proposal was not swallowed by Lincoln. He
realized that acceptance might involve estrangement from
his own party&mdash;no small matter for one who was ambitious
politically. He was wise enough to counsel with the leading
Whigs and his personal friends as to the prudence of such
an alliance. They advised an agreement. It is claimed by
Lamon that Lincoln and Dawson made a bargain with the
Democratic party that nearly demoralized the Whigs, decidedly
weakening the vote of their favorite champion, Major
Stuart.<a name="FNanchor_87_88" id="FNanchor_87_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_88" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> In fact, the alliance was more disastrous to the
enemy. The Whigs fared well, as it was, in the campaign;
and in a year or two, Sangamon County, a former stronghold
of Jackson, passed into the control of the followers of
Clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p><p>We have no evidence as to whether Lincoln was less a partisan
in the campaign as the result of Democratic endorsement.
It was largely a "hand shaking" canvass, a man to
man combat. Affable to every one, Lincoln was master
in this mode of securing support. On one occasion he came
upon thirty men in a field. They declared they would not
vote for a man unless he could make a hand. "Well, boys,"
said he, "if that is all, I am sure of your votes." Taking
hold of the cradle, he led the way all the round with perfect
ease, and the boys were satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_88_89" id="FNanchor_88_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_89" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>"The next day he was speaking at Berlin. He went from
my house with Dr. Barnett, the man that had asked me who
this man Lincoln was. I told him that he was a candidate
for the Legislature. He laughed and said, 'Can't the party
raise no better material than that?' I said, 'Go to-morrow,
and hear all before you pronounce judgment.' When he
came back, I said, 'Doctor, what say you now?' 'Why, sir,'
said he, 'he is a perfect take-in; he knows more than all of
them put together.'"<a name="FNanchor_89_90" id="FNanchor_89_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_90" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>"Mr. J. R. Herndon, his friend and landlord, heard him
make several speeches about this time, and gives us the following
extract from one, which seems to have made a special
impression upon the minds of his auditors: 'Fellow citizens,
I have been told that some of my opponents have said that
it was a disgrace to the County of Sangamon to have such
a looking man as I am stuck up for the Legislature. Now,
I thought this was a free country; that is the reason I address
you to-day. Had I known to the contrary, I should
not have consented to run; but I will say one thing, let the
shoe pinch where it may; when I have been a candidate before
you five or six times, and have been beaten every time,
I will consider it a disgrace, and will be sure never to try it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
again; but I am bound to beat that man if I am beat myself.
Mark that!'"<a name="FNanchor_90_91" id="FNanchor_90_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_91" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Voting at this period was <i>viva voce</i> and not by ballot.
One seeking the vote of Lincoln, pompously supported him.
Lincoln thereupon voted against that candidate. Those who
witnessed the action marveled much and approved his conduct.<a name="FNanchor_91_92" id="FNanchor_91_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_92" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
At this election, of the four successful candidates
for Sangamon County, Dawson received 1390 votes; Lincoln
followed with 1376. Stuart, the popular Whig, had nearly
200 votes less.<a name="FNanchor_92_93" id="FNanchor_92_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_93" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> These figures speak with eloquence of the
advance made by the surveyor in two years.</p>

<p>"After he was elected to the Legislature," says Mr. Smoot,
"he came to my house one day in company with Hugh
Armstrong. Says he, 'Smoot, did you vote for me?' I told
him I did. 'Well,' says he, 'you must loan me money to buy
suitable clothing, for I want to make a decent appearance
in the Legislature.' I then loaned him two hundred
dollars, which he returned to me according to promise."<a name="FNanchor_93_94" id="FNanchor_93_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_94" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Compelled by events to be his own teacher, Lincoln learned
to depend on his own resources. Reared in a rough school,
accustomed to be a leader among his intellectual inferiors,
still, in all humility, he looked to his legislative experience
with joy. Deprecating his kind of education, open minded
he anxiously awaited the privilege of associating with many
of the leading men of the State. There gathered at the Capitol
its best blood, the choice sons of Illinois, the representatives
of the ambition, the intelligence, and the popularity of
the State. "The society of Vandalia and the people attracted
thither by the Legislature made it, for that early day, a gay
place indeed. Compared to Lincoln's former environments, it
had no lack of refinement and polish. That he absorbed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
good deal of this by contact with the men and women who
surrounded him, there can be no doubt. The 'drift of sentiment
and the sweep of civilization' at this time can best be
measured by the character of the legislation. There were
acts to incorporate banks, turnpikes, bridges, insurance companies,
towns, railroads and female academies. The vigor
and enterprise of New England fusing with the illusory prestige
of Kentucky and Virginia was fast forming a new civilization
to spread over the prairies."<a name="FNanchor_94_95" id="FNanchor_94_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_95" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln with modesty remained a witness of the doings
of the Legislature. Content to wait for the fitting time to
make an impression, he did not rush into debate. It was a
scouting period. Scanty of talk, rich in thought, ever on
the lookout for information, steady in attendance, studying
parliamentary procedure, he gained a name for solidity, far
better than brilliancy or oratory for real influence in a
legislative body.<a name="FNanchor_95_96" id="FNanchor_95_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_96" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln forgot the prudence expressed in his first circular,
for he jumped into the movement that hurried along the internal
improvement policy. His practice was behind his
theory in matters of finance.</p>

<p>Lincoln made little stir in this session, he took no glorious
part in its deliberations, and made no record for independence.
He usually voted with the members of his party. He
became grounded in the finesse of law making, an art whose
acquirement and importance are seldom considered. For
method as well as merit is an element in the making of the
statute. Still, in measuring himself with his associates, he
gained confidence and found that he was not far behind in
the training for political prosperity. While he would not
deceive, he learned how not to be deceived. He discovered
that men in the Senate are not of a far different order from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
those in the field; that culture often hides a mean soul; that
polish is often the tinsel of education. He remained the
same Lincoln, longing for the reality of the old life without
pretense. He was content to return to his admirers in Clary
Grove, with no exaltation or pride in his new distinction as
legislator.</p>

<p>A special session of the Legislature was held in December,
1835. One of the evils of the time was the eagerness of
representatives for public offices of a more permanent character
than the uncertain tenure of popular election. New
offices were constantly created. Lincoln took a bold stand on
the danger. He voted with the majority that the election
of a member of the Legislature to a State office was corrupting.
He voted with the minority to apply the principle also
to relatives and connections of the members. Lincoln remained
a persistent supporter of internal improvements.
Some of the advocates shifted their votes from time to time,
but he remained constant in his devotion.</p>

<p>The influence of Lincoln extended over a widening territory
and his fame spread with new opportunities. After
two scant years of public life, he was considered among the
leaders of his party. No longer waiting on the advice of
friends, he offered himself as a candidate for renomination.
He initiated his campaign with the following political fulmination:</p>

<p>"To the Editor of the <i>'Journal'</i>: In your paper of last
Saturday I see a communication, over the signature of 'Many
Voters,' in which the candidates who are announced in the
<i>Journal</i> are called upon to 'show their hands.' Agreed, here's
mine.</p>

<p>"I go for all sharing the privileges of the government
who assist in bearing its burdens. Consequently, I go for
admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
or bear arms (by no means excluding females).</p>

<p>"If elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon
my constituents, as well those that oppose as those that
support me.</p>

<p>"While acting as their representative, I shall be governed
by their will on all subjects upon which I have the means
of knowing what their will is; and upon all others I shall
do what my judgment teaches me will best advance their interests.
Whether elected or not, I go for distributing the
proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the several States,
to enable our State, in common with others, to dig canals
and construct railroads without borrowing money and paying
the interest on it.</p>

<p>"If alive on the first Monday in November, I shall vote for
Hugh L. White for President. Very respectfully. A. Lincoln."<a name="FNanchor_96_97" id="FNanchor_96_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_97" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>In commanding contrast to his first circular, this fairly
seems to crowd out every dispensable expression. Contact
with the pioneer had taught him to court the power of
brevity, so this announcement is more like a creed than an
address. Homely and curt in character, it suited the time.
It was the best way to the heart of the average voter. Democracy
found in it its own image. Lincoln leans more than
a little to the popular. He advocates the distribution of
the public lands money for the building of canals and railroads
without borrowing money, and openly declares his
subserviency in being governed by the public will on all questions.</p>

<p>Much attention has been dedicated to the suggestion advocating
an equality of suffrage. This expression loses considerable
significance considering its random character.
There is little subsequent evidence of his belief in female suffrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as a wise and just political measure. Still, it may be
fairly assumed that the untrammeled mind of Lincoln, with
a sure faith in universal suffrage, followed the cherished doctrine
to the end. "All such questions," he observed one day
to Herndon as they were discussing temperance in his office,
"must first find lodgment with the most enlightened souls
who stamp them with their approval. In God's own time
they will be organized into law and thus woven into the
fabric of our institutions."<a name="FNanchor_97_98" id="FNanchor_97_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_98" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The request of candidates to "show their hands" was of
special significance at this time. It was a transitional period,
the parting of ways between the "whole hog Jacksonite"
and the moderate Democrat. There was no room for
lukewarm adherents. It was a period of positive alliance.
Diplomacy was no longer a factor. The center of gravity
shifted from local to national affairs. Contests became
partisan controversies on general issues.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1836 is the low ebb of the old personal
campaign, where every man fought his own battle on his
own worth, where the people judged every candidate on
individual merit. This is the last time seekers of office are
asked "to show their hand." From that time, political affiliation
and not personal worth began to be the marrow of a
contest. Partisan devotion submerged personal fealty. The
people involuntarily created parties, and straightway became
slaves of their own handiwork, selling independence for
party loyalty. Partisanship held them in its clutches, and
they hardly dared to loosen its embrace. The man who
ventured to exercise his judgment was charged with being
a weakling, or opened himself to the impious accusation in a
democratic community that he regarded himself greater than
his party. The vision of the average worker in the ranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
became near sighted, and the bias of his judgment knew no
limit. Party spirit set free an element of discord among
men that sundered friendships, wrought enmities between
brothers, and banished reason. From that time even Lincoln
ceased to gather any considerable support from his
political antagonists.</p>

<p>Lincoln was wise enough to note the tendency of these
events. Wasting no regrets over the new conditions, he
bound himself to the party of his choice without equivocation.
Fairly but energetically maintaining the sanctity of
the Whig principles, he became a fearless and feared champion
of its doctrine. He displayed keen political wisdom
in this conduct. Partisanship seldom rewards the laggard
in the day of prosperity.</p>

<p>That Lincoln entered with zeal into this campaign and
indulged in the fashion of the day in the issuance of handbills
of a flaring character, the following is significant evidence:</p>

<blockquote><p>"TO THE PEOPLE OF SANGAMON COUNTY&mdash;Fellow
Citizens: I have this moment been shown a handbill
signed 'Truth Teller' in which my name is done up in large
capitals. No one can doubt the object of this attack at
this late hour. An effort is now made to show that John T.
Stuart and myself opposed the passage of the bill by which
the Wiggins loan was paid. The handbill says&mdash;the only
vote taken on the bill when the yeas and nays were taken
was upon engrossing the bill for a third reading. 'That's a
lie!' Let the reader refer to pages 124, 125 and 126 of the
Journal and he will see that the yeas and nays were taken
<i>twice</i> upon the bill <i>after</i> the vote referred to by this lying
Truth Teller, and he will also see that my course toward
the bill was anything but unfriendly. It is impossible to
make a lengthy answer at this late hour. All I have to say
is that the author is a liar and a <i>scoundrel</i>, and that if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
will avow the authorship to me, I promise to give his proboscis
a good wringing. A. Lincoln."<a name="FNanchor_98_99" id="FNanchor_98_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_99" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>One of the sure signs of the spirit of increasing partisanship
was the virulence and bitterness of political gatherings.
Contests between leaders became frequent. Debates were
had on the prairie that equaled in earnestness senatorial
controversies. There was all the high tension of the gladiatorial
combat intensified by the championship of something
more than a personal issue&mdash;the stake of party principles.
We are informed that on one occasion a Whig candidate,
at the top of his voice, branded the statement of a Democratic
opponent, as false. As passion ran high, a duel
seemed a likely result. Lincoln followed on the program.
With his marvelous fairness he discussed the subject gently
and serenely so as to satisfy friend and foe. Judicial,
though earnest in advocacy, he fully calmed the tumult.<a name="FNanchor_99_100" id="FNanchor_99_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_100" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>It was doubtless at this time that the following incident
deeply disturbed his calmness. Something had displeased
the "wild boys" who had been his supporters from the first.
Perhaps a rumor that he affected strange ways, or voted
for some measure not to their liking, caused the trouble.
The leader at once gave the call and they gathered. Seldom
revealing himself, he then gave freedom to his emotion.
He told them that he never would forget those who had
given him his start, the men who stood by him, who had
made him what he was and all that he hoped to be. He
bade them if they still cherished unkindness, if they still
held him guilty, to tear him to pieces limb by limb. The
generous hearts of the frontiersmen, overcome by this unwonted
display of feeling, lost all resentment, and the leader
regained his prestige thus rudely shaken.<a name="FNanchor_100_101" id="FNanchor_100_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_101" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>Early in the campaign Lincoln spoke at Springfield. Some
of the Clary Grove boys and other admirers followed him,
confident that he would distinguish himself at his first appearance.
They were not slow in claiming that he would
make a better stump speech than any one at the county seat.
He splendidly defended the principles of his party, and produced
a profound impression. Among his auditors was a
Mr. Forquer, who had the finest house in Springfield, lately
protected by the only lightning rod in that locality. Formerly
a Whig, his apostasy was rewarded with a lucrative
office. He felt the sting of Lincoln's strong presentation of
the principles of the Whig party. The recent recruit to the
Democratic organization replied by a speech able and apparently
fair, still skillfully mingled with sarcasm. Scorn and
satire were freely used, so that the anxiety of the friends
of Lincoln was awakened. Speed relates that his reply to
Forquer was characterized by great dignity and force; that
he would never forget the conclusion of that speech. "Mr.
Forquer commenced his speech," said Lincoln, "by announcing
that the young man would have to be taken down. It
is for you, fellow citizens, not for me to say whether I am
up or down. The gentleman has seen fit to allude to my
being a young man; but he forgets that I am older in years
than I am in tricks and trades of politicians. I desire to
live, and I desire place and distinction; but I would rather
die now than, like the gentleman, live to see the day that I
would change my politics for an office worth three thousand
dollars a year, and then feel compelled to erect a lightning
rod to protect a guilty conscience from an offended God."<a name="FNanchor_101_102" id="FNanchor_101_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_102" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln showed supreme skill in striking a chord in the
pioneer heart. He knew the thoughts of the plain people,
knew that they hated every pretension of manner. For many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
years whenever Forquer rose to speak he was pointed at as
the man who put a lightning rod on his house to ward off the
vengeance of the Supreme Power.<a name="FNanchor_102_103" id="FNanchor_102_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_103" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Lincoln was not averse
to appeal to other sentiments of the people. At a gathering
of farmers in joint debate with his rival, he said: "I am
too poor to own a carriage, but my friend has generously
invited me to ride with him. I want you to vote for me if
you will; but if not then vote for my opponent, for he is
a fine man."<a name="FNanchor_103_104" id="FNanchor_103_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_104" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In this campaign, Lincoln rose to eminence as a political
speaker. From that time he was one of the stalwart Whigs
selected by common consent for leadership in the contests
with their strong disciplined and victorious opponents. Lincoln's
services were given popular endorsement. He led all
the rest of his able associates.<a name="FNanchor_104_105" id="FNanchor_104_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_105" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>In the Legislature of 1836 Lincoln played the part of a
politician. The external side of his career is described by
Lamon, who declares that "he was the smartest parliamentarian
and the cunningest 'log roller.'"<a name="FNanchor_105_106" id="FNanchor_105_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_106" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The State was now aglow with enthusiasm over the prospects
of the policy of internal improvements. A few days
before the Legislature assembled, a mass convention in Sangamon
County instructed their members to vote for the
system of internal improvements.<a name="FNanchor_106_107" id="FNanchor_106_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_107" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> This was one of the
many manifestations of the public sentiment.</p>

<p>Lincoln followed the common political ambition of his
time. He became an aggressive champion of the public improvement
policy. He told his friend Speed, in confidence,
that he aimed at the great distinction of being called the
"De Witt Clinton of Illinois." With many other public men
of that day he ventured the hope of rivalling the fame of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the builder of the Erie Canal.<a name="FNanchor_107_108" id="FNanchor_107_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_108" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> A leading member of the
finance committee, he was foremost in urging the popular
measures by which everybody was to be enriched by some
stroke of statesmanship, some mysterious manipulation in
finance. The state loans were to construct railroads, the
railroads were to build cities; the cities in turn were to
create a demand for farms; capital rushing for investment
was to follow, and lands were steadily to rise in value. The
tax on real estate was to go into a sinking fund, and thus
shuffle off local assessment. In this fine way taxation was
to be banished.<a name="FNanchor_108_109" id="FNanchor_108_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_109" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> With untiring step many followed the
vision. Politics as well as fancy every now and then has its
lamp of Aladdin.</p>

<p>No one voted more persistently for local and State improvements,
relief acts and the incorporation of organizations,
than Abraham Lincoln. This was not done in darkness.
The solemn protest of some sane members was put
forth against the prevailing folly that held its repeated
jubilations in the Legislature. They commented on the
madness of the immense schemes, on the multitude of officers
with ample salaries. They dimly prophesied shadow and
gloom to the hopes of the enamored majority.<a name="FNanchor_109_110" id="FNanchor_109_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_110" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Another
resolution advising consultation with the people before borrowing
money for all the contemplated enterprises received
only nine votes. Lincoln was not among that eminent minority.<a name="FNanchor_110_111" id="FNanchor_110_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_111" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Governor Ford makes the following stinging comment on
those who put into operation the internal improvement policy:
They have been excused upon the ground that they
were instructed to vote as they did, and that they had every
right to believe that they were truly reflecting the will of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
constituents. But members ought to resign such small offices,
to sacrifice a petty ambition, rather than become the willing
tools of a deluded people, to bring so much calamity upon
the country.<a name="FNanchor_111_112" id="FNanchor_111_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_112" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The chief task of Lincoln and the other members of the
Sangamon delegation in the tenth biennial session of the
Legislature was to secure the removal of the capital from
Vandalia to Springfield. This called forth his utmost ingenuity.
Many rivals sought the prize. It was no mean
problem to grasp victory from a crowd of contending communities.
Lincoln set himself resolutely to the practical
problem. It demanded patience, skill and every art of the
legislator. Twice its enemies laid the Springfield bill on
the table. He gathered his despairing associates for counsel
in the hour of seeming defeat. The bill was squeezed
through at the last moment.</p>

<p>Governor Ford and other Democrats seriously believed,
and long repeated the charge, that the "Long Nine," as the
Sangamon delegation was called, "log rolled the removal"
through the Legislature. Nicolay and Hay, however, contend
that the removal was due to the adroit management of
Mr. Lincoln&mdash;first in inducing all the rival claimants to unite
in a vote to move the capital from Vandalia, and then carrying
a direct vote for Springfield through the joint convention
by assistance of the Southern counties. They cite as
evidence of this personal influence of Lincoln the statement
of a legislator: "He made Webb and me vote for the removal,
though we belonged to the southern part of the state.
We defended our vote before our constituents by saying
that necessity would ultimately force the seat of government
to a central position. But in reality we gave the vote to
Lincoln because we liked him, because we wanted to oblige<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
our friend, and because we recognized him as our leader."<a name="FNanchor_112_113" id="FNanchor_112_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_113" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
This statement is not sufficient to meet the contention that
the removal was cunningly attained. The personal power
of Lincoln with some legislators may have been an availing
factor. Still the majority of the lawmakers were men
moved mainly by material considerations. It is not reasonable
to assume that in voting on a vital and important
proposition they would not highly consider its effect on their
own measures; that they would enable the Sangamon delegation
to return triumphantly to their constituents without
some understanding of reciprocity. That Lincoln reluctantly
or otherwise made some peculiar alliances or engaged
in some questionable strategy may be reasonably
deduced from the admission: "I also tacked a provision onto
a fellow's bill, to authorize the relocation of the road from
Salem down to your town, but I am not certain whether or
not the bill passed. Neither do I suppose I can ascertain
before the law will be published&mdash;if it is a law."<a name="FNanchor_113_114" id="FNanchor_113_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_114" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Still there is stirring evidence that Lincoln would not
barter his principles even for the success of his most cherished
purpose in that session. An effort was made to unite
the friends of Springfield with those of a measure Lincoln
refused to sanction. Every argument was used to influence
Mr. Lincoln to yield his objections, and thus secure the
removal of the capital to his own city, but without effect.
Finally after midnight, when the candles were burning low
in the room, he rose amid the silence and solemnity which
prevailed, and made an eloquent and powerful speech, saying
in conclusion: "You may burn my body to ashes, and
scatter them to the winds of heaven; you may drag my soul
down to the regions of darkness and despair to be tormented
forever; but you will never get me to support a measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
which I believe to be wrong, although by doing so I may
accomplish that which I believe to be right."<a name="FNanchor_B_115" id="FNanchor_B_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_115" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>In matters involving method and detail, he used every art
of the politician. Still when principle was at stake, he
would not bow to expediency. With rare precision, he
keenly followed the hazy border land between principle and
policy. In securing results, he surpassed common politicians;
in fealty to integrity he rivalled the patriot.</p>

<p>The year 1837 was a crucial period in many respects for
Lincoln. He had steadily moved forward until he became
the leader of New Salem. He had shown superior skill
as a local politician. But his future as lawyer and politician
in New Salem was already bounded. With his success
as a legislator and the applause of larger communities, his
longing for fame and power grew stronger. With no keen
regret, he sundered the ties that bound him to Clary Grove
where his word was law, to enter upon a life of more varied
and extensive character. His entrance into Springfield was
as humble as that into New Salem. Speed relates that Lincoln
came into his store, set his saddle bags on the counter,
and inquired what a single bedstead would cost. Being told
that the amount complete was seventeen dollars, Lincoln
said that it was cheap enough, but cheap as it was, he did
not have the money to pay, but if he would be trusted
until Christmas, and his experiment there as a lawyer was
a success, he would pay then, if he failed he would probably
never pay at all. The tone of his voice was so full of pathos
that Speed felt for him, and he thought that he never saw
so gloomy and melancholy a face in his life, and he then
told Lincoln that he had a very large room and a very large
double bed in it, which he was welcome to share with him.
Without saying a word Lincoln took his saddle bags on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
his arm, went upstairs, set them down on the floor, came
down again, and with a face beaming with pleasure and
smiles, exclaimed, "Well, Speed, I'm moved."<a name="FNanchor_114_116" id="FNanchor_114_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_116" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>In the special session of 1837, the accusation that the
removal of the capital was born of "bargain and corruption,"
challenged the integrity of the Sangamon delegation.
A prominent Democrat, General Ewing, thus taunted them:
"The arrogance of Springfield, its presumption in claiming
the seat of government is not to be endured; the law has
been passed by chicanery and trickery; the Springfield delegation
has sold out to the internal improvement men, and
has promised its support to every measure that would gain
a vote to the law removing the seat of government."<a name="FNanchor_115_117" id="FNanchor_115_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_117" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> That
Lincoln hurried to the defence of the onslaught of an eminent
opponent, is another indication that he was rapidly
becoming chief of his fellows. He here displayed the same
kind of talent that won him applause from audiences on
the prairie.<a name="FNanchor_116_118" id="FNanchor_116_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_118" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> General Linder states that then, for the first
time, he began to conceive a very high opinion of the talents
and personal courage of Abraham Lincoln. The intervention
of friends alone averted a duel between Lincoln and
Ewing.<a name="FNanchor_117_119" id="FNanchor_117_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_119" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>During this session, a resolution was introduced by Mr.
Linder for a legislative inquiry into the affairs of the State
Bank, generally known to be in a hazardous condition. The
introducer ventured to support his resolution with a tone
of superiority that invited chastisement. Again Lincoln
bore the brunt of the defence, railing at Mr. Linder about his
pretensions, saying that in one faculty at least, there could
be no dispute of the gentleman's superiority over him and
most other men, and that was, the faculty of so entangling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a subject that neither himself, nor any other man, could
find head or tail to it.<a name="FNanchor_118_120" id="FNanchor_118_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_120" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>In speaking of the resolution itself, Lincoln indulged in
these typical expressions: It is an old maxim and a very
sound one, that he who dances should always pay the fiddler.
I am decidedly opposed to the people's money being used
to pay the fiddler. These capitalists generally act harmoniously
and in concert to fleece the people; and now that they
have got into a quarrel with themselves, we are called upon
to appropriate the people's money to settle the quarrel.<a name="FNanchor_119_121" id="FNanchor_119_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_121" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
The people know their rights and they are never slow to
assert and maintain them when they are invaded. I make
the assertion boldly, and without fear of contradiction, that
no man who does not hold an office, or does not aspire to
one, has ever found any fault with the bank. No, sir, it is
the politician who is first to sound the alarm (which by
the way, is a false one.) It is he who by these unholy
means, is endeavoring to blow up a storm that he <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'made'">may</ins> ride
upon and direct. Mr. Chairman, this work is exclusively
the work of politicians&mdash;a set of men who have interests aside
from the interests of the people, and who, to say the most
of them, are, taken as a mass, at least one step removed
from honest men. I say this with the greater freedom, because,
being a politician myself, none can regard it as personal.<a name="FNanchor_120_122" id="FNanchor_120_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_122" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The speech was published in the <i>Sangamon Journal</i> with
the editorial comment that Lincoln's remarks on Linder's
bank resolution were quite to the point; that he carried the
true Kentucky rifle, and when he fired he seldom failed sending
the shot home.<a name="FNanchor_121_123" id="FNanchor_121_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_123" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln's bold words about the politician, modified by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
quaint admission, allow us a glimpse of the inner man. It
took no mean courage to make so unpalatable an assertion.
Still tempering his speech with his rare kind of diplomacy,
he did not suffer in the estimation of his associates, those
whose esteem he valued.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>PROTESTER AND PATRIOT</h3>


<p>The year 1837 is the culmination of the first period of
abolitionism in Illinois. Until then, abolitionism was a
hated eastern conception. Despite opposition, and somewhat
feeding on it, it slowly filtered its way through an almost
impervious public sentiment. A small band encountered
with heroism, the continuous martyrdom that waits on the
protagonist. Few in numbers, zealous in their gospel, superbly
confident in the rectitude of their counsel they
aroused the spirit of retaliation. Their excessive zeal transcended
all other obligations, rendering them indifferent,
if not hostile, to the constitutional compact. They stimulated
and encouraged to life a corresponding bitterness
among the multitude.</p>

<p>It was in those days a mortal offence to call a man an
abolitionist. The popular mind scarcely distinguished between
men who stole horses and men who freed negroes.
They regarded anti-slavery men as robbers, disturbers of
the peace, the instigators of arson, and enemies to the Union
which gave us as a people liberty and strength. "In testimony
of these sentiments, Illinois enacted a 'black code' of
most preposterous and cruel severity,&mdash;a code that would
have been a disgrace to a slave state, and was simply an
infamy in a free one. It borrowed the provisions of the
most revolting laws known among men, for exiling, selling,
beating, bedeviling, and torturing negroes, whether bond or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
free."<a name="FNanchor_122_124" id="FNanchor_122_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_124" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>That the opposition of slavery was bothering the people
of Sangamon County, is evident from the following resolution
adopted at Springfield in 1837 at a public meeting, over
which Judge Brown presided:</p>

<p>"Resolved that in the opinion of this meeting the doctrine
of the immediate emancipation of the slaves of this
country (although promulgated by those who profess to be
Christians) is at variance with Christianity, and its tendency
is to breed contention, broil and mobs; and the leaders of
those calling themselves Abolitionists are designing ambitious
men and dangerous members of society and should be
shunned by all good citizens."<a name="FNanchor_123_125" id="FNanchor_123_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_125" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Illinois would scarcely brook unchained utterance on the
darkest question of all the ages,&mdash;the "right of one man to
eat the bread which another earned." A kind of stifling
ostracism awaited the lowly or the towering disciple who
spoke in the language of Jefferson, of the fear awakening
problem. Every generation has its remorseless method of
crucifying its heroes of speech and deed. Business and
political interests, social influences and religious affiliations
concerted in the crushing of abolitionism. Success might
have crowned their effort had prudence been their companion,
but they mobbed, maltreated, and even murdered the
champions of the new movement. Had madness confounded
them, they could not have acted more unwisely. This, more
than all the agitation of abolition leaders, quickened the
moral vitality of the people. There were many white men
who cared little for the slave, but much for the gospel of
free speech as old as the Anglo-Saxon race. This fatal
policy of brute force finally dictated the doom of a power
that long mocked all opposition, that dreamed of an imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
government grander than the vision which "Stout
Cortez" beheld when he first stared at the Pacific, "silent
on a peak in Darien."</p>

<p>The motives that prompted public sentiment in Illinois to
throttle discussion on the slave question, almost baffle understanding.
The Lovejoys attacked no vested interest in the
State, menaced no substantial rights of person or property.
While the Southern States busied themselves with the doctrine
that it was the privilege of each State to demean itself
as it wished, subject only to the Constitution, as it interpreted
that instrument, there was small occasion for a Northern
commonwealth to curb its own citizens, to sacrifice
ancient and cherished rights for the pleasure of an exacting
foreign institution.</p>

<p>The anti-slavery forces with keenness of vision saw the
weak point of the enemy's attack, so they ranged themselves
round the banner, proclaiming the doctrine of free speech
and the sacredness of an unshackled press. Nothing more
inherently reveals the weakness of the advocates of slavery,
than their morbid fear of free and frank inquiry into its
policy and wisdom. In the face of an institution demanding
mob power, and the sacrifice of priceless principles, the
Abolitionists performed a wholesome public service in contending
that then more than ever liberty of discussion should
be protected, maintained and hallowed.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the same year up starts Lincoln the statesman,
Lincoln the politician sinks. He possessed the rare
gift of concealing his most cherished opinions until the time
was ripe for expression. He was aware of the folly of mouthing
truths when no good could come therefrom. In this,
he was a politician. Still when the occasion called for an
act of fortitude, when the solemnity of the hour summoned
heroic utterance, as from "heights afar," the sound of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
voice was heard and the thrill of his words awakened. In
this, he was a supreme statesman.</p>

<p>Strange medley of the ideal and the practical,&mdash;at times
he appeared the very woof of the visionary, and then stood
forth as a petty politician. He was a mystery and a wonder
to his contemporaries. They never beheld such a man;
they had no standard by which to measure him. First, amazing
some by the minuteness of his strategy, he would then
startle others by a bold proclamation of immortal truth.
There was something elusive in the manifoldness of his nature.
The world with childlike simplicity looks for uniformity
of action, for consistency. So it was that in later years
time-servers called Lincoln the apostle of radicalism, and
radicals named him the slave of conservatism.</p>

<p>The legislature instead of branding the black crime of
the murder of Lovejoy in 1837, hastened to pass resolutions
of sympathy with slavery. No external inducement guided
Lincoln to fly in the face of the sentiment of the Legislature,
the State and Nation in regard to Abolitionism. His conduct
mystifies unless the abiding impress of the incident at New
Orleans is fully measured. It was no idle vaunt that stirred
him to the declaration that if he ever had the chance he
would strike a blow for the enslaved. The testing time was
at hand. His oath was "registered in Heaven." It was
necessary to join the majority in their defence of slavery, or
strike a lonely path in behalf of the enslaved. His soul faced
that crisis. No longer helpless, he was widely known, and
was distinguished for his services as a political leader. High
in position, his act and word carrying weight, he proclaimed
his protest. The chance being at hand, he struck slavery a
stinging blow. The silence of nearly a decade was broken
in words that shall echo for evermore. Only one other representative,
Dan Stone, of Sangamon County, dared to sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the following signal dissent that will save him from an oblivion
that has already enshrouded those who voted for the successful
resolutions:</p>

<blockquote><p>"They believe that the institution of slavery is founded
on both injustice and bad policy, but that the promulgation
of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate the
evils.</p>

<p>"They believe that the Congress of the United States has
no power under the Constitution to interfere with the institution
of slavery in the different States.</p>

<p>"They believe that the Congress of the United States has
the power, under the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the
District of Columbia, but that the power ought not to be
exercised, unless at the request of the people of the District.</p>

<p>"The difference between these opinions and those contained
in the said resolutions is their reason for entering this protest.</p>

<div class="center">
"Dan Stone,<br />
"A. Lincoln.<br />
"Representatives of the County of Sangamon."<a name="FNanchor_124_126" id="FNanchor_124_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_126" class="fnanchor">[124]</a><br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The resolutions that passed the General Assembly were
still rather conservative for the time and place. The protest
of Lincoln is therefore the more significant, as indicating
its origin from some deep mental or moral sentiment.
Every letter in the protest is weighed. No product of
Lincoln is more native to his genius. It is as restrained
as a judicial decision. Avoiding unneeded antagonism,
it is framed with admirable diplomacy. Radical in
thought, still so moderate in expression, it saved his power
for further good, not placing him beyond fellowship with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
his associates. Yet with all its subdued character, with
infinite wisdom it made the assault at the weakest point,
declaring that slavery was founded, not only on injustice, but
<i>bad policy</i>. In the last phrase lurked the sting that was
to awaken the self-interest of the North, the same kind of
selfishness that solidified the South in defending the institution.
Lincoln was among the first to grasp and lay stress
on the warp of the issue. He once declared that honest
statesmanship was the employment of individual meanness
for the public good. When self-interest became enlisted with
conscience against the evil, its days were numbered. While
Abolitionism was noisily tugging at one of the pillars that
supported human bondage, Lincoln serenely forged an argument
linking its moral and industrial weakness, an argument
that finally shook its very foundation, until the peculiar
institution that dominated the destiny of the nation for
more than half a century tumbled to destruction. While
other men were forced to change their opinions through the
malignancy of slavery to keep abreast of public sentiment,
Lincoln remained steadfast in his opinions and his policy.
At the outset, he foresaw that no institution could last long
that rested on injustice and bad policy. Only a change of
external conditions separated the man who entered a solemn
protest against the iniquity of slavery in a hostile community
and the leader who gave life to the momentous act
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The period preceding the murder of Lovejoy was an era
of unrest. The mob spirit ranged over the land. Thus in
commenting upon the murder of the mulatto McIntosh, Lovejoy
says: "In Charlestown it burns a Convent over the head
of defenseless women; in Baltimore it desecrates the Sabbath,
and works all that day in demolishing a private citizen's
house; in Vicksburg it hangs up gamblers, three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in a row; and in St. Louis it forces a man&mdash;a hardened
wretch certainly, and one that deserves to die, but not <i>thus</i>
to die&mdash;it forces him from beneath the aegis of our constitution
and laws, hurries him to the stake and burns him alive!"<a name="FNanchor_C_127" id="FNanchor_C_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_127" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Without doubt, the murder of Lovejoy and similar incidents
drew the mind of Lincoln to the discussion of the subject
of the preservation of our institutions. For Herndon
has left valuable testimony as to the influence of like events
on his own opinions. The cruel and uncalled-for murder
aroused anti-slavery sentiments, penetrating the college at
Jacksonville where he was attending, and both faculty and
students were unrestrained in their denunciation. Herndon's
father, believing that the college was too strongly permeated
with the virus of Abolitionism, forced him to withdraw from
the institution. But Herndon declares that it was too late;
that the murder of Lovejoy filled him with more desperation
than the slave scene in New Orleans did Lincoln. For while
the latter believed in non-interference with slavery, as long
as the Constitution authorized its existence, Herndon, although
acting nominally with the Whig party up to 1853,
struck out for Abolitionism pure and simple.<a name="FNanchor_125_128" id="FNanchor_125_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_128" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>In the fall of 1837, Lincoln addressed the Young Men's
Lyceum at Springfield, Illinois, in a formal discourse bearing
traces of considerable preparation. The style is fulsome and
fanciful, and unlike his own crisp utterance of previous or
subsequent periods. For a time he wandered from his natural
self and followed the glitter of what he doubtless deemed
a more cultivated form of expression. Thus it begins: "In
the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the
American people, find our account running under date of the
nineteenth century of the Christian era. We find ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth
as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil and salubrity
of climate. We find ourselves under the government of a
system of political institutions conducing more essentially
to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which
the history of former times tells us."<a name="FNanchor_126_129" id="FNanchor_126_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_129" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>It is especially important to take note of Lincoln's attitude
of the prevailing mob spirit. His treatment of that
theme, his mode and manner and thought, is so like that of
the editor of the <i>Alton Observer</i>, that it is reasonable to
assume that there was a common origin to the common sentiment.
The same scenes and events that stirred the soul of
Lovejoy aroused that of Lincoln. His direct onslaught on
the mob spirit being largely connected with the slave issue,
was an indirect attack on slavery. In this, Lincoln and the
Abolitionists stood on the same ground. He extravagantly
denounced the malefaction of the mobs, saying that they
pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana; and
alike sprang up among the pleasure-hunting masters of
Southern slaves, and the order-loving citizens of the land of
steady habits, that this process of hanging went on from
gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from
these to strangers, till dead men were seen literally dangling
from the boughs of trees upon every roadside. He further
insisted that by the operation of this mobocratic spirit, the
strongest bulwark of any government might effectually be
broken down and destroyed&mdash;the attachment of the people.
He contended that whenever the vicious portion of population
should be permitted to burn churches, ravage provision
stores, throw printing presses into rivers, shoot editors, and
hang and burn obnoxious persons with impunity, this government
could not last.<a name="FNanchor_127_130" id="FNanchor_127_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_130" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>Under the display of such extravagant expression there is
still patriotic apprehensiveness of danger to the national
existence. He fought out the solution of the problem unaided
until the way seemed clear and plain. To him the
remedy was simple&mdash;obedience to the law of the land.</p>

<p>"Let reverence for the law be breathed by every American
mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap; let
it be taught in schools, in seminaries and in colleges; let it
be written in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it
be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls,
and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it
become the political religion of the nation, and let the old
and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the
gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice
unceasingly upon its altars....</p>

<p>"When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the
laws, let me not be understood as saying there are no bad
laws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of
which no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say
no such thing. But I do mean to say that although bad
laws if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible,
still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example
they should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arises, let proper legal provision be made for
them with the least possible delay, but till then, if not too
intolerable, be borne with."<a name="FNanchor_128_131" id="FNanchor_128_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_131" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>His remedy bespeaking reverence for the laws, would destroy
the rampant spirit in the slavery movement and in
abolitionism, so that neither would violate the law of the
land, and so that the controversy might be conducted without
intruding on the sanctity of the fundamental principles
of the Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>From this time, Lincoln ceased to be a mere local politician.
He became intensely concerned over national questions.
Naturally, a man of broad views, he soon threw off the coil
of locality, and with zeal invaded the arena of national
issues. His mind ranged over the general domain for materials.
Local issues were only stepping stones to him.
Leaving the valley of minor matters, with exuberant spirits,
he rejoicingly entered the new land of larger import, and
of broader moment to the weal of the nation. For the first
time he encountered extensive questions concerning the very
foundations of the Republic.</p>

<p>"Towering genius," he said, "disdains a beaten path. It
seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in
adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected
to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough
to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps
of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns
for distinction; and if possible, it will have it, whether at
the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen."<a name="FNanchor_129_132" id="FNanchor_129_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_132" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>We here strike a golden vein in his character. Ranging
over the world's activities for an illustration to rival the
ambition of towering genius, he finds it in the enslavement or
emancipation of a race. Out of the loneliness of his individuality,
out of the solemnity of his deliberations, he grew
into a great character. It is his own illustration dug out of
his mental experience, a product of a mind brooding over
a national destiny. He saw with unerring vision, for men
did come in his own generation who did not scruple to climb
to power upon the back of an enslaved people. The true
Lincoln consists not only of the humble man, of homely face,
gaunt form, shambling limbs, quaint utterance, rude story
and humble way. We may also see him in his early manhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
with Titan power, fighting and triumphing over the brute
forces of his being, over his ambition, and towering to the
greatness of righteous triumph. Conduct is only the shadow
of soul struggle. Nearly three decades before the Emancipation,
its destiny was determined in no small measure by the
events that led to the murder of Lovejoy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>PARTISAN IN STATE AND NATIONAL AFFAIRS</h3>


<p>The campaign of 1838 did not differ materially from
that of previous years. A colleague of Lincoln says
that they called at nearly every home; that it was customary
to keep some whiskey in the house, for private use and to
treat guests; that the subject was always mentioned as a
matter of etiquette, but with the remark to Lincoln that
though he never drank, his friend might like to take a little.
Lincoln often told his associates that he never drank and had
no desire for drink, nor the companionship of drinking men.</p>

<p>Some light is thrown on the nature of the conduct of office
seekers by the following incident: During this campaign,
Douglas and Stuart, candidates for Congress, "fought like
tigers in Herndon's grocery, over a floor that was drenched
with slops, and gave up the struggle only when both were
exhausted. Then, as a further entertainment to the populace,
Mr. Stuart ordered a 'barrel of whiskey and wine.'"<a name="FNanchor_130_133" id="FNanchor_130_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_133" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Joshua Speed states that some of the Whigs contributed
a purse of two hundred dollars to enable Lincoln to pay his
personal expense in the canvass. After the election, the candidate
handed Speed $199.25, with the request that he return
it to the subscribers. "I did not need the money," said he,
"I made the canvass on my own horse; my entertainment being
at the houses of friends, cost me nothing; and my only
outlay was seventy-five cents for a barrel of cider, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
some farm hands insisted I should treat them to."<a name="FNanchor_131_134" id="FNanchor_131_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_134" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>On one occasion, Col. Taylor, a demagogue of the Democratic
party, was hypocritically appealing to his "horny
handed neighbors" in language of feigned adulation. Lincoln
knew his man. He deftly removed the vest of the orator
and revealed to his astonished hearers "a ruffled shirt front
glittering with watch chain, seals and other golden jewels."
The speaker stood confused. The audience roared with
laughter. When it came Lincoln's turn to answer, he retorted.
"While Colonel Taylor was making these charges
against the Whigs over the country, riding in fine carriages,
wearing ruffled shirts, kid gloves, massive gold watch chains
with large gold seals, and flourishing a heavy gold-headed
cane, I was a poor boy, hired on a flat-boat at eight dollars
a month, and had only one pair of breeches to my back, and
they were buckskin. Now if you know the nature of buckskin
when wet and dried by the sun, it will shrink; and my
breeches kept shrinking until they left several inches of my
legs bare between the tops of my socks and the lower part of
my breeches; and whilst I was growing taller they were
growing shorter, and so much tighter that they left a blue
streak around my legs that can be seen to this day. If you
call this aristocracy I plead guilty to the charge."<a name="FNanchor_132_135" id="FNanchor_132_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_135" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>When the Legislature convened in 1838, Lincoln was a
candidate of his party for speaker. His opponent was chosen
by a plurality of one vote. Lamon declares that this
distinction was a barren honor, and known to be such at the
time, but cites no reason for his statement.<a name="FNanchor_133_136" id="FNanchor_133_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_136" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> At least the
humble representative of Sangamon County continued to rise
in the esteem of his associates. His activity was crowned
with the approval of those with whom he fought side by
side in the turmoil and debate of controversy. It is a significant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
indication of his diplomacy. He had so won the confidence
of his companions that even differences on that slavery
issue did not cause him the loss of their esteem and favor.
The recipient of such an honor is likely to be the possessor of
amiable personal qualities that call forth devotion, even more
than the sturdy qualities of talent and ability.<a name="FNanchor_134_137" id="FNanchor_134_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_137" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> In matters
of political expediency, Lincoln did not run athwart the
sentiments of the majority. Despite the mutterings of discontent
in some quarters, despite a growing feeling that the
internal improvement policy was likely to involve the State
in disaster, the finance committee, of which Lincoln was a
prominent member, advised even further indulgence in the
fatal policy. Finally, the fearful financial condition of the
State stared the people and their representatives in the face.
The supporters of the internal improvement system stubbornly
began to yield to the policy of retrenchment. Still,
in the Special Session of 1839, assembled to deliberate over
the momentous state of affairs, Lincoln with peculiar logic
urged they were so far advanced in a general system of internal
improvements that they could not retreat from it
without disgrace and great loss, and that the conclusion was
that they must advance.<a name="FNanchor_135_138" id="FNanchor_135_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_138" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was one of thirty-three members to vote for laying
the bill repealing improvements on the table, while sixty opposed
this action; and he was one of thirty-five who voted
against the repeal of the internal improvement policy, while
thirty-seven voted for it.<a name="FNanchor_136_139" id="FNanchor_136_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_139" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Thus, to the very end, Lincoln
persisted in the disastrous policy that clouded the history
and prosperity of Illinois for many years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>Lincoln basked in political events. He was alive to the
details in political strategy. In November, 1839, he wrote
to Stuart, his partner, in regard to a voter: "Evan Butler is
jealous that you never send your compliments to him. You
must not neglect him next time."<a name="FNanchor_137_140" id="FNanchor_137_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_140" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>From the very beginning, he concerned himself with the
candidacy of General Harrison. Recognizing its elemental
political strength, he watched its growth with increasing interest.
Harrison had never distinguished himself as a public
citizen. Lincoln looked at the political side of the picture
alone, little dreaming that the day was to come when his
election was to depend, in some measure, on the same emotions
that promoted the triumph of Harrison. In both campaigns
the log cabin played a dominant part.</p>

<p>Speed's store in Springfield was the retreat of Lincoln,
Douglas and Baker, and other political leaders of the dominant
parties. However, partisanship was about to triumph,
and common meeting places were soon to become unknown.
In December, 1839, just as the campaign of 1840 was looming
up, a political discussion between the leaders grew violent
in the grocery over the national issue. During the angry
debate, Douglas, with his imperial manner, flung forth the
taunt: "Gentlemen, this is no place to talk politics; we will
discuss the question publicly with you."<a name="FNanchor_138_141" id="FNanchor_138_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_141" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln, who had schooled himself in logical dissertation,
loved a political contest. He had met the champions of the
Legislature without dismay, and was more feared than fearing.
Shortly afterward Lincoln presented a resolution to
accept the flaunting challenge of Douglas. Logan, Baker,
Browning and Lincoln were the chosen disputants of the
Whig cause. The Democrats put forth Douglas, Calhoun,
Lambourn and Thomas as their champions. Each speaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was allowed an evening for his address. This controversy
was long known as "the great debate."<a name="FNanchor_139_142" id="FNanchor_139_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_142" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>That Lincoln was climbing to eminence slowly, that he
was marvelously free from egoism and the aggressiveness of
the common political orator is manifest from the first paragraph
of his address: "It is peculiarly embarrassing to me
to attempt a continuance of the discussion, on this evening,
which has been conducted in this hall on several preceding
ones. It is so because on each of these evenings there was
a much fuller attendance than now, without any reason for
its being so, except the greater interest the community feel
in the speakers who addressed them than they do in him who
is to do so now. I am, indeed, apprehensive that the few
who have attended have done so more to spare my mortification
than in the hope of being interested in anything I may
be able to say. This circumstance casts a damp upon my
spirits, which I am sure I shall be unable to overcome during
the evening."<a name="FNanchor_140_143" id="FNanchor_140_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_143" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>His manner of holding an opponent to the point at issue,
his directness of speech are strikingly displayed: "I now ask
the audience, when Mr. Calhoun shall answer me, to hold
him to the questions. Permit him not to escape them. Require
him either to show that the subtreasury would not injuriously
affect the currency, or that we should in some way
receive an equivalent for that injurious effect. Require him
either to show that the subtreasury would not be more expensive
as a fiscal agent than a bank, or that we would
in some way be compensated for the additional expense."<a name="FNanchor_141_144" id="FNanchor_141_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_144" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Although of limited experience in public controversy, the
least known of the Whig debaters, diffident of his own capacity,
yet he sought the most brilliant and distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
debater in the Democratic party&mdash;Douglas. Free from
sham, he was merciless in exposing it in others, as the following
attack on his elusive antagonist indicates: "Those
who heard Mr. Douglas recollect that he indulged himself
in a contemptuous expression of pity for me. 'Now, he's got
me,' thought I. But when he went on to say that five millions
of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the French
indemnities, which I knew to be untrue; that five millions
had been for the Postoffice, which I knew to be untrue; that
ten millions had been for the Maine boundary war, which
I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely ridiculous also;
and when I saw that he was stupid enough to hope that I
would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to
be unexposed,&mdash;I readily consented that, on the score both
of veracity and sagacity, the audience would judge whether
he or I were the more deserving of the world's contempt."<a name="FNanchor_142_145" id="FNanchor_142_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_145" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Sober in the main as the speeches of Webster, on the currency
issue Lincoln only once let loose his rollicking and suffusing
sense of humor: "The Democrats are vulnerable in
the heel&mdash;I admit is not merely figuratively, but literally
true. Who that looks but for a moment at their Swartwouts,
their Prices, their Harringtons, and their hundreds
of others, scampering away with the public money to Texas,
to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a villain
may hope to find refuge from justice, can at all doubt that
they are most distressingly affected in their heels with a
species of 'running itch.' It seems that this malady of their
heels operates on these sound-headed and honest-hearted
creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song did
on its owner: which, when he had once got started on it,
the more he tried to stop it, the more it would run away."<a name="FNanchor_143_146" id="FNanchor_143_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_146" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>That he was still subject to the fashion of pioneer exuberant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
expression; that he was somewhat entangled in the growing
partisanship of the time, is thoroughly evident from his
stormy peroration: "Many free countries have lost their
liberty, and ours may lose hers; but if she shall, let it be
my proudest plume, not that I was the last to desert, but
that I never deserted her. I know that the great volcano at
Washington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that
reigns there, is belching forth the lava of political corruption
in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping with
frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the
land, bidding fair to leave unscathed no green spot or
living thing; while on its bosom are riding, like demons on
the waves of hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and fiendishly
taunting all those who dare resist its destroying course
with the helplessness of their effort; and, knowing this, I
cannot deny that all may be swept away. Broken by it I,
too, may be; bow to it I never will. The probability that
we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the
support of a cause we believe to be just; it shall not deter
me."<a name="FNanchor_144_147" id="FNanchor_144_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_147" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>This fulsome conclusion more than his sustained logical
argument swept over his audience and made it a popular
success, so that admiring friends promoted its publication
in the Sangamon <i>Journal</i>. Lamon, however,
curtly makes this dampening comment on his eloquent diction:
"Considering that the times were extremely peaceful,
and that the speaker saw no bloodshed except what flowed
from the noses of belligerents in the groceries about Springfield,
the speech seems to have been unnecessarily defiant."<a name="FNanchor_145_148" id="FNanchor_145_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_148" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The Committee of Whigs in charge of Harrison's political
campaign in Illinois issued a circular urging the organization
of the whole State for the Presidential contest. Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was a prominent member of this body and his style
shows through this appeal. It was a combination of skillful
play to party spirit, and a thorough knowledge of the mode
of conducting a successful campaign. "To overthrow the
trained bands that are opposed to us, whose salaried officers
are ever on the watch, and whose misguided followers are
ever ready to obey their smallest commands, every Whig
must not only know his duty, but must firmly resolve, whatever
of time and labor it may cost, boldly and faithfully to
do it. Our intention is to organize the whole State, so that
every Whig can be brought to the polls in the coming presidential
contest. We cannot do this, however, without your
cooperation; and as we do our duty, so we shall expect you
to do yours."<a name="FNanchor_146_149" id="FNanchor_146_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_149" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>The circular then proposed a new method of bringing out
the full Whig vote, in essence the same that is now employed
by every successful political organization. The following
was the plan of organization:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) To divide every county into small districts, and to
appoint in each a subcommittee, with the duty to make a
perfect list of all the voters, and to ascertain their choice
with certainty, all doubtful voters to be designated in separate
lines.</p>

<p>(2) To keep a constant watch on the doubtful voters, and
from time to time have them talked to by those they trusted,
and to place in their hands convincing documents.</p>

<p>(3) To report, at least once a month, and on election
days see that every Whig was brought to the polls.<a name="FNanchor_147_150" id="FNanchor_147_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_150" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was brought up in a practical school where votes
are a matter of calculation, where the things done on the
stage were plotted and planned behind the stage. Few men
were more thoroughly trained in the methods of securing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
results. He eagerly wrote to Stuart for copies of the
"Life of Harrison," and also requested "The Senate Journal
of New York" of September, 1814. "I have a newspaper
article which says that that document proves that Van
Buren voted against raising troops in the last war. And
in general send me everything you think will be a good 'war-club.'"<a name="FNanchor_148_151" id="FNanchor_148_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_151" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
He was learning that political battles are won
and lost, not alone on discussion of principles, but on appeals
to the emotions of men.</p>

<p>As a politician, his judgment prevailed over his sentiment.
He was not carried away by the enthusiasm of the hour, but
looked beneath the surface for events that suggested public
sentiment. So he noted with discernment "A great many of
the grocery sort of Van Buren men, as formerly, are out
for Harrison. Our Irish blacksmith, Gregory, is for Harrison.
I believe I may say that all our friends think the
chances of carrying the State very good."<a name="FNanchor_149_152" id="FNanchor_149_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_152" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>For the first time in years, the Whigs conducted a campaign
more aggressive than that of their opponents. General
Harrison represented no definite political policy. The
log cabin, the coon skin cap, the political songs, the enthusiasm
of even the children, all this was more potent than the
solid and sober discussion of such issues as the currency,
executive power, American labor, protection and internal
improvements.</p>

<p>The sober thinking and dignified leaders of the Whig party
were somewhat shocked by the uncouth campaign of 1840.
It was not in keeping with the dignity of its traditions.
Leaders like Webster brooked with impatience a campaign
in which judgment was fairly forgotten.</p>

<p>The whole campaign was one of luxuriant freedom, of intense
excitement, of exaggerated discourse. A resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
adopted at Springfield during March, indicates the language
that was abroad: "Resolved, that the election of Harrison
and Tyler would emancipate the land from the Catilines who
infest it; would restore it to prosperity and peace, and bring
back the time when good measures, good principles and good
men would control the administration of our government."<a name="FNanchor_150_153" id="FNanchor_150_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_153" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was foremost in the emotional fight of 1840. With
all the zeal of eager youth, he rushed into the contest. As a
presidential elector, he traversed a large portion of the State.
Thus a newspaper of the day says: "He is going it with a
perfect rush. Thus far the Locofocos have not been able to
start a man that can hold a candle to him in political debate.
All of their crack nags that have entered the list
against him have come off the field crippled or broke down.
He is now wending his way north."<a name="FNanchor_151_154" id="FNanchor_151_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_154" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>An incident little known, but of vast importance in illumining
the kind of orator Lincoln was in 1840, is found in an
almost forgotten book. Therein we find the impression that
gaunt Lincoln made upon a cultured resident and distinguished
lawyer of St. Louis, who says that at a gathering of
Whigs in April, 1840, at Belleville, Mr. Lincoln was the first
speaker to an immense crowd. "He rang all the changes upon
'coon skins,' 'hard cider,' 'log cabins,' etc., and among other
things he launched forth in true Lincoln style and manner
and said he had been 'raised over <i>thar</i> on Irish potatoes and
buttermilk and mauling rails.'... I went to Col. Edward
Baker, I think it was, and told him for goodness sake to
try and get Lincoln down from the stand; that he was
doing us more harm than good ... when Lincoln goes to
weaving his buttermilk, etc., it would seem as if we were
verging rather too near onto the ridiculous. We succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
very soon in getting Lincoln down from the stand and got
up another speaker who seemed to have more judgment in
managing the canvass."<a name="FNanchor_152_155" id="FNanchor_152_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_155" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>This statement should not be neglected. It is the judgment
of a civilization different from that of pioneer Illinois.
Events had hardly sobered the style and the manner of the
sensitive politician of Sangamon County. Later on he grew
to a more reserved and severe exposition of political discussion,
grew to appeal to the judgment rather than the sentiments
of men, grew to lift the debate of the hour above the
clash of partisan controversy.</p>

<p>During this campaign, he once failed to come up to the
requirements of the occasion in a debate with Douglas. A
friend describes his distress at his failure: "He begged to
be permitted to try it again, and was reluctantly indulged;
and in the next effort he transcended our highest expectations.
I never heard and never expect to hear such a triumphant
vindication as he then gave of Whig measures or
policy. He never after, to my knowledge, fell below himself."<a name="FNanchor_153_156" id="FNanchor_153_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_156" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The debates of this campaign were a product of the excited
and heated condition of the public mind. Thus, Gen.
John Ewing, of Indiana, challenged the whole Democratic
party and threatened to annihilate it. Douglas was pitted
against him. There was no formality at the meetings. Each
was to speak an hour alternately. The debate was to begin
at eight and adjourn at twelve; meet at two and continue
to sundown each day until the contest would be ended. At
the end of the fifth day, Ewing "threw up the sponge," and
a vigorous shout was given by the Democrats. "E. D. Baker,
notified of Ewing's defeat, mounted a butcher block and began
to address us. They protested that the game of 'two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
pluck one' could not be tolerated. He persisted and at once
the cry was raised 'pull him down.' At length he yielded,
otherwise it would have ended with a number of broken
heads."<a name="FNanchor_154_157" id="FNanchor_154_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_157" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Another incident still further discloses the character of
the controversy that prevailed at that period. Arnold says
that Baker was speaking in a room under Lincoln's office, and
communicating with it by a trap door. Lincoln in his office,
listened. Baker, becoming excited, abused the Democrats.
A cry was raised, "Pull him off the stand!" Lincoln, knowing
a general fight was imminent, descended through the
opening of the trap door, and springing to the side of Baker,
said: "Gentlemen, let us not disgrace the age and country
in which we live. This is a land where freedom of speech is
guaranteed. Baker has a right to speak, and a right to be
permitted to do so. I am here to protect him, and no man
shall take him from this stand if I can prevent it." Baker
finished without further interruption.<a name="FNanchor_155_158" id="FNanchor_155_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_158" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln and Douglas often met in debate in this campaign.
Lamon states that Lincoln in the course of one speech imputed
to Van Buren the great sin of having voted in the
New York State Convention for negro suffrage with a property
qualification. Douglas denied the fact, and Lincoln
attempted to prove his statement by reading a certain passage
from Holland's Life of Van Buren, whereupon Douglas
got mad, snatched up the book, and, tossing it into the
crowd, remarked sententiously, "Damn such a book!"<a name="FNanchor_156_159" id="FNanchor_156_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_159" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The above encounter shows Lincoln's method of attack.
He followed his brilliant antagonist with facts that all his
ingenuity could not evade. From that day, Lincoln loved
nothing better than a fray with the feared champion of Democracy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
No other Whig orator could fret Douglas as Lincoln
did. They were as different in mental and moral outlook
as they were in appearance. Lincoln saw through his
skillful opponent. He knew his strength and he knew his
weakness. He was prepared for his chameleon-like attacks
and onslaughts. While contemporaries hardly saw in Lincoln
the future rival of the growing Douglas, still Lincoln
was gaining strength in the technic of debate that was later
to be of inestimable service to him in controversies of national
import.</p>

<p>In the 1840-1 Legislature, Lincoln was again the candidate
of his party for speaker. As leader of the minority, he
doubtless deemed it an obligation on his part to provide some
plan to pay the State debt and save its honor. He no longer
cherished the illusion of gaining fame as the DeWitt Clinton
of Illinois. There were some in the Legislature who boldly
favored repudiation of the whole State debt. Others advocated
payment of such part of it as the State actually received
an equivalent for. Only a few dared to demand adequate
taxation for the payment of the interest on the bonds.
That was an unpopular expedient.</p>

<p>Lincoln walked the middle way. He was not a friend of repudiation
and still he did not court a loss of public esteem
by proposing substantial direct taxation. His bill provided
that the Governor should issue interest bonds as might be
absolutely necessary for the payment of the interest upon
the lawful debt of the State. He declared that he submitted
the proposition with great diffidence; that he felt his share
of the responsibility in the crisis; and, that after revolving
in his mind every scheme which seemed to afford the least
prospect of relief, he submitted this as the result of his own
deliberations; that it might be objected that the bonds
would not be salable; that he was no financier, but that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
believed the bonds would be equal to the best in the market,
and that as to the impropriety of borrowing money to pay
interest on borrowed money,&mdash;he would reply, that if it
were a fact that our population and wealth were increasing
in a ratio greater than the increased interest hereby incurred,
then it was not a good objection.<a name="FNanchor_157_160" id="FNanchor_157_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_160" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>He concluded with characteristic modesty that, "he had
no pride in its success as a measure of his own, but submitted
it to the wisdom of the House, with the hope, that, if
there was anything objectionable in it, it would be pointed
out and amended."<a name="FNanchor_158_161" id="FNanchor_158_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_161" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Lamon calls it a loose document, as the Governor was to
determine the "amount of bonds necessary," and the sums
for which they should be issued, and interest was to be paid
only upon the "lawful" debt; and the Governor was to determine
what part of it was lawful and what was unlawful.<a name="FNanchor_159_162" id="FNanchor_159_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_162" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Still in essence, Lincoln's plan of leaving the determination of
the lawfulness of the debt to an authority not the legislative,
was finally adopted.<a name="FNanchor_160_163" id="FNanchor_160_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_163" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The shameless interference with the judicial system of Illinois
about 1840 luridly illustrates the enslaving partisanship
of that time. Under the provision of the State Constitution
permitting every white male adult to vote, aliens had known
the right of suffrage for years. Nine-tenths of the aliens
allied themselves with the Democratic organization so that
their support was essential to its success. As the Presidential
contest grew in intensity there sprang up a controversy
about these unnaturalized voters. Each party arrayed itself
on the side of its own interest. The Whigs maintained
that the Federal Constitution had provided against the participation
of aliens in the affairs of government. A test<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
case was brought to the Illinois Supreme Court which consisted
of three Whigs and one Democrat. The latter informed
Douglas, in advance, that the majority had agreed
upon a decision unfavorable to the alien vote, but that there
was a technical error in the record. This knowledge became
serviceable to the Democrats. The case, by reason of
the imperfection, was put over to the December term, and
10,000 alien votes saved the State for another Democratic
administration.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Whig judges was made a pretext to reorganize
the judiciary by increasing their number, thus enabling
the political complexion of that tribunal to represent
the party in power. Early in the winter, however, the Supreme
Court rendered a decision that affirmed the contention
of Douglas and his party. Still, the advocates for reorganization
were not stayed in their purpose, and they moved
forward in what they termed a reformation of the judiciary.</p>

<p>This action of making the judiciary dependent on the
Legislature was extremely pernicious in immediate results.
It also started political impulses malignant and enduring,
little appreciated by those who wantonly inaugurated the
change. The participation of Douglas in this enterprise was
effectively utilized by Lincoln in the debate of 1858. It is
not surprising that Lincoln and other Whigs in the Legislature
were unwilling witnesses of this degradation. They
framed protests, declaring that the immutable principles of
justice were to make way for party interests, and the bonds
of social order were to be rent in twain, in order that a desperate
faction might be sustained at the expense of the people;
that the independence of the judiciary had been destroyed;
that hereafter the courts would be independent of
the people, and entirely dependent upon the Legislature; that
rights of property and liberty of conscience could no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
be regarded as safe from the encroachments of unconstitutional
legislation.<a name="FNanchor_161_164" id="FNanchor_161_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_164" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>This strong statement from the Whigs represented the conscience
of the State. The protesting element is generally
alert in awakening public sentiment or responding to it on
the issues of the day, thus affording a wholesome check upon
the dominant organization in making inroads upon righteous
government. In this way, it becomes the selfish interest of at
least one political party to be on the side of honest statesmanship.</p>

<p>At no time was Lincoln more active in legislative affairs
than during the early part of the 1840-41 session. In the
internal improvement system, bank discussions, the attack
upon the Sangamon delegation and in almost every legislative
proceeding he was ready to bear his share of the fight.</p>

<p>But during the session, an event occurred that shadowed
his political career. Lincoln, the democrat, the man of humility,
of common ancestry, was attracted to Mary Todd,
a Southern aristocrat, a woman of beauty and ambition.
Lamon finds the source of this in selfishness, saying: "Born
in the humblest circumstances, uneducated, poor, acquainted
with flatboats and groceries, but a stranger to the drawing-room,
it was natural that he should seek in a matrimonial
alliance those social advantages which he felt were necessary
to his political advancement."<a name="FNanchor_162_165" id="FNanchor_162_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_165" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>This biographer overlooks the fact that it is not an uncommon
event for a homely, humble man to be diverted from
the common highway as Lincoln was. It is very hard to
read in this story anything of designing selfishness. At one
time severing his engagement to Miss Todd, the same despondency
that crushed him upon the death of Ann Rutledge
again became his master. His own words describe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his condition: "I am now the most miserable man living.
If what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human
family, there would not be one cheerful face on the earth.
Whether I shall ever be better, I cannot tell; I awfully forebode
I shall not. To remain as I am is impossible; I must
die or be better, it appears to me."<a name="FNanchor_163_166" id="FNanchor_163_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_166" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>He was absent from the Legislature for nearly
three weeks. A visit to his friend Speed in Kentucky recalled
him to his better nature.<a name="FNanchor_164_167" id="FNanchor_164_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_167" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The injustice he had done
Miss Todd rankled until a reconciliation followed. Out of
this there arose events that culminated in a duel. Though
this event was soon hushed, yet its echoes lingered, for he
said in 1858, "If all the good things I have done are remembered
as long and as well as my scrape with Shields, it is
plain I shall not soon be forgotten."<a name="FNanchor_165_168" id="FNanchor_165_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_168" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The panic of 1837 and the disintegration of the internal
improvement system were holding their requiem over the
finances of the State. Money was a furtive visitor. The currency
of the State banks, fairly worthless, was nearly the
only circulating medium. During the summer of 1841, the
Administration invalidated the use of State Bank notes for
the payment of taxes but the salary of lawmakers was still
payable in currency. The Whigs hastened to charge the
state officers with adding to the burdens of the people that
they might be assured of their salaries. The Auditor of
the State was James Shields. Rather vain and aggressive,
he was not inclined "to beware of an entrance into a
quarrel."</p>

<p>It was at this time that Lincoln was having stolen conferences
with Miss Todd. The restless spirit of the latter
sought the political field for adventure. A daughter of leisure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
she had no rival in sarcasm in Springfield. Hunting
for material, she found a subject in the pretentious Auditor,
and enjoyed worrying the sensitive official. Under such influences,
Lincoln aided or sanctioned the composition of an
article ridiculing Shields. Like many similar productions,
it professed to come from a back-woods settlement, and affected
a homely if not a vulgar form of speech. The paragraph
that follows is a sample of the effusion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I looked in at the window, and there was this same fellow
Shields floatin' about on the air, without heft or earthly substance,
just like a lock of cat-fur where cats have been
fightin'.</p>

<p>"He was paying his money to this one, and that
one, and t'other one, and sufferin' great loss because it wasn't
silver instead of State paper; and the sweet distress he
seemed to be in,&mdash;his very features, in the ecstatic agony of
his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly, 'Dear girls, <i>it is distressing</i>,
but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know how
much you suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault
that I am <i>so</i> handsome and <i>so</i> interesting.'"<a name="FNanchor_166_169" id="FNanchor_166_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_169" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The production appeared in the Sangamon <i>Journal</i>, and
at once aroused the wrath of Shields. A demand for the
identity of the author followed. Doubtless to save Miss
Todd from entanglement, Lincoln announced himself as the
writer. Thereupon, Shields demanded a full retraction of all
offensive allusions. Strangely enough, Lincoln did not welcome
this solution of the situation. He took advantage of
the rather ardent demand for an apology and held his ground
with these words: "Now, sir, there is in this so much assumption
of facts and so much of menace as to consequences, that
I cannot submit to answer that note any further than I have,
and to add that the consequences to which I suppose you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
allude would be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly
could to you."<a name="FNanchor_167_170" id="FNanchor_167_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_170" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>With such a start, a duel for a time seemed inevitable. At
the last moment, common friends conveniently, and doubtless
to the great satisfaction of the contestants, calmed the affair
without a real encounter.</p>

<p>Duelling was the rage of the hour.<a name="FNanchor_168_171" id="FNanchor_168_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_171" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Lincoln was too sensitive
to the good opinion of the community to fly in the
face of popular sentiment. So he violated the law of the
State to engage in a transaction unsanctioned by his judgment,
not ready to defy the general taste in a matter where
the standard was still that of the pioneer community. It is
not therefore surprising that in later years, Lincoln was
abashed by his part in this fight. This was his last personal
quarrel, and marks a decisive epoch in his career.<a name="FNanchor_169_172" id="FNanchor_169_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_172" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Thereafter, he became a champion of principles and was prepared
to play a part in debates of world-wide moment.</p>

<p>A dramatic contest ran through this session on the part
of the banks to obtain further condonation in the suspension
of specie payments. The Whigs were friendly, calling them,
"the institutions of the country," branding opposition unpatriotic.
The Democrats, however, were on the whole hostile
to the banks. They called them "rag barons, rags,
printed lies, bank vassals, ragocracy, and the 'British-bought
bank, bluelight, Federal, Whig party.'"<a name="FNanchor_170_173" id="FNanchor_170_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_173" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The contest was rendered closer by "opportune loans to
Democrats." The fight grew in intensity as if the wealth,
the industry and the very happiness of the people were at
stake. The Democrats, in order to kill the banks, were bent
on a <i>sine die</i> adjournment of the special term. The Whigs
in their zeal to save them invented what was a novel expedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
at that time in parliamentary tactics. The Whigs absented
themselves to prevent a quorum, leaving Lincoln and Gillespie
to call the ayes and noes. The Democrats discovered the
game, and the sergeant-at-arms was sent out. There was
great excitement in the House, which was then held in a
church at Springfield. Soon several Whigs were caught and
brought in and the plan was spoiled. Then Lincoln and his
accomplice determined to leave the hall. Going to the door,
and finding it locked, they raised a window and jumped out,
but not until the Democrats had succeeded in adjourning.
Mr. Gillespie remarked that "Lincoln always regretted that
he entered into that arrangement, as he deprecated every
thing that savored of the revolutionary."<a name="FNanchor_171_174" id="FNanchor_171_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_174" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>This incident discloses Lincoln the politician, Lincoln the
student of methods engaging in practices that his judgment
subsequently disapproved. He was thoroughly schooled in
securing results. The student of Lincoln should not hurry
over this incident, nor minimize its significance. He mingled
in common, sordid, political events.</p>

<p>Though Lincoln engaged freely in the political machinations
of his day, he did not sanction corruption. He stood
out as a champion of an untainted franchise. He did not
still his conscience with the soothing medicine that corruption
was the common practice. He moved at this session
that the part of the Governor's message relating to fraudulent
voting be referred to the Committee on elections, with
instructions to prepare and report a bill for such an act as
might afford the greatest possible protection of the elective
franchise against all frauds.<a name="FNanchor_172_175" id="FNanchor_172_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_175" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Bred in the school of partisanship, where the doctrine that
spoils is the fruit of victory, was almost a creed, Lincoln
never enslaved himself by the acceptance of that dogma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
either in practice or theory. Early in life he had reasoned
out the principle that public office is a trust. He dared to
assert its integrity at a time when it met little favor. He
wrote in 1840 that he was opposed to removal of public
officials to make places for friends.<a name="FNanchor_173_176" id="FNanchor_173_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_176" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Still, the malevolent
conduct of an office holder stirred his resentment. In the
same letter he said there was no question as to the propriety
of removing the postmaster at Carlinville, that the latter
boldly refused to deliver during the canvass all documents
franked by Whig members of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_174_177" id="FNanchor_174_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_177" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>By his tact and service, Lincoln stood well with the party
leaders, so that in 1841 he was widely mentioned as a worthy
candidate for Governor. A formal protest from his hand
and that of his close friends against such a movement was
put in the Sangamon <i>Journal</i>: "His talents and services endear
him to the Whig party; but we do not believe he desires
the nomination. He has already made great sacrifices in
maintaining his party principles, and before his political
friends ask him to make additional sacrifices, the subject
should be well considered. The office of Governor, which
would of necessity interfere with the practice of his profession,
would poorly compensate him for the loss of four of the
best years of his life." Whether he could have attained the
nomination is not known. Lincoln was not accustomed to
put aside political honors. It is significant that the young
legislator readily availed himself of a mode of self-glorifying
declination popular with politicians to this day.<a name="FNanchor_175_178" id="FNanchor_175_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_178" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>With this session, Lincoln concluded his duties as the representative
of the people. In 1832, he entered Vandalia, a
son of poverty, timid of his ability, ungifted in appearance.
In eight years, he plowed his way to the very front as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
champion of his associates, a skillful leader of his party.
Still it is amazing how faint a trace Lincoln left on the history
of Illinois, hewing out no legislative enactment endearing
his memory to the people of the State. Ford only notes
him as a Congressman who in the State Legislature followed
the glitter of a false finance, and a destructive plan of public
improvement. Had his career ended here, no one would have
ventured to rescue his name from oblivion. One act only,
overtops the events submerged by time, an event that sober
history passed by, little knowing that it was the one fact,
richer than all others, in the annals, under its scrutiny. For
in the light of later events, the protest of 1837 showed an
enkindled soul that in the goodness of time thrilled the land
with a second edition of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>RESTLESS POLITICAL AMBITION</h3>


<p>The termination of Lincoln's legislative career, his marriage
and his increasing legal practice did not stay his
hunger for political distinction. Music, society or nature
did not allure him. His range of interest was limited. His
pleasure was not in his fame as a counselor. He was impatient
of the tiresome devotion to detail demanded of the lawyer.
Longing to be a leader in the world of events, he
sought a wider field of activity for the full expression of his
personality, splendidly realizing that his greatest service to
himself and his fellows was in guiding and interpreting a
righteous public opinion.</p>

<p>Lamon has portrayed Lincoln's political ambition with
merciless vividness, claiming that he was never agitated by
any passion more intense than his thirst for distinction; that
it governed all his conduct, from the hour when he astonished
himself by his oratorical success in the back settlements
of Macon County, to the day when the assassin
marked him as the first hero of the restored Union; that he
was ever ready to be honored, and struggled incessantly for
place.<a name="FNanchor_176_179" id="FNanchor_176_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_179" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Politics was his world,&mdash;a world filled with enchantment.
"In his office," says Mr. Herndon, "he sat down, or
spilt himself on his lounge, read aloud, told stories, talked
politics,&mdash;never science, art, literature, railroad gatherings,
colleges, asylums, hospitals, commerce, education, progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
nothing that interested the world generally except politics."<a name="FNanchor_177_180" id="FNanchor_177_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_180" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Yet Lamon and Herndon missed the deeper unity in his
life. Neither politics nor distinction was the end with him.
They were the paths leading to his palace, not the palace
itself. It is not too much to say that love of his kind transcended
his love of distinction. At the time when he seemed
lost in the maelstrom of partisanship, as Burns in the storm
thought of the "ourie" cattle, so Lincoln thought of those
hapless sons of misfortune who were biding the "bitter
brattle" of slavery. Thus in a letter to his friend Speed,
he said, "In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water
trip on a steamboat from Louisville to St. Louis. You
may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth
of the Ohio there were on board ten or a dozen slaves
shackled together with irons. That sight was a continued
torment to me, and I see something like it every time I
touch the Ohio or any other slave border."<a name="FNanchor_178_181" id="FNanchor_178_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_181" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>The extent to which he mingled in political affairs is shown
by his activity at a mass meeting in March, 1843, at Springfield.
He was the master of ceremonies. In a careful statement,
he uttered the cardinal principles of his party. He
was materially steeped in the party spirit of his day. For the
fifth resolution recommends that a Whig candidate for Congress
be run in every district, regardless of the chances of
success. "We are aware," it continued, "that it is sometimes
a temporary gratification, when a friend cannot succeed,
to be able to choose between opponents; but we believe
that that gratification is the seed time which never fails to
be followed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness. By
this policy we entangle ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_179_182" id="FNanchor_179_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_182" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Though Lincoln, at first, fought the convention system for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the nomination of candidates, as undemocratic, his conversion
to its championship further exposes his training in the
school of practical politics. The statement declared that
the Whigs should not stop to inquire whether the system was
just, but that while their opponents used the plan it was
madness in them not to defend themselves with it.<a name="FNanchor_180_183" id="FNanchor_180_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_183" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion of this address is also a sure sign of prolonged
association with the hue and cry of party spirit: It
stated with assurance that the Whigs were always a majority
of the nation, and that if every Whig would act as though
he knew the result to depend upon his action, that surely a
Whig would be elected President of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_181_184" id="FNanchor_181_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_184" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Political office being the reward of party service, Lincoln
was a zealous worker in the ranks. He was ever at the call
of the party managers for speeches or other personal work.
They could not charge him with being a laggard in the day
of defeat. He did not wait for waves of advancement. He
was not in accord with the policy that the office should seek
the man. He slowly toiled his way to the eminence he
reached. While Lincoln was in Congress, Herndon wrote
to him complaining of his sluggard progress in politics, and
carped at the old men for usurping all the places of power
and profit. In an intimate reply to his associate, we find
the plain paths he trod: "You must not wait to be brought
forward by the older men. For instance, do you suppose that
I should ever have got into notice if I had waited to be hunted
up and pushed forward by older men? You young men get
together and form a 'Rough and Ready Club,' and have regular
meetings and speeches. Take in everybody you can get.
Harrison Grimsley, L. A. Enos, Lee Kimball, and C. W. Matheny
would do to begin the thing; but as you go along
gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about town, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
just of age or a little under age,&mdash;Chris. Logan, Reddick
Ridgely, Lewis Swizler, and hundreds such. Let every one
play the part he can play best,&mdash;some speak, some sing, and
all 'holler.' Your meetings will be of evenings; the older
men and the women will go to hear you; so that it will not
only contribute to the election of 'Old Zach,' but will be an
interesting pastime, and improving to the intellectual faculties
of all engaged. Don't fail to do this."<a name="FNanchor_182_185" id="FNanchor_182_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_185" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln no sooner completed his long term in the Legislature
than he cast his eye on a seat in Congress. "Now, if
you should hear" he wrote a friend, "any one say that Lincoln
don't want to go to Congress, I wish you, as a personal
friend of mine, would tell him you have reason to believe he
is mistaken. The truth is I would like to go very much.
Still, circumstances may happen which may prevent my being
a candidate. If there are any who be my friends in such an
enterprise, what I now want is that they shall not throw me
away just yet."<a name="FNanchor_183_186" id="FNanchor_183_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_186" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln's race for the nomination was full of excitement.
When he began his canvass, he was a member of the firm of
Logan and Lincoln. Besides Hardin, Baker and Lincoln,
Logan also was a candidate. Logan deemed his long service
as entitling him to the honor, while Lincoln regarded his
legislative career as his claim to distinction. It is not amazing
that concord did not dwell in this home of political
rivalry. Herndon says he was not, therefore, surprised to
have Lincoln rush into his quarters and with more or less
agitation tell him that he had determined to sever the partnership
with Logan; and Herndon states that although
painfully aware of his want of ability and experience, when
Lincoln remarked in his earnest, honest way, "Billy, I can
trust you if you can trust me," he felt relieved and accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the generous proposal of legal partnership.<a name="FNanchor_184_187" id="FNanchor_184_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_187" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The most dramatic incident in this fight was the contest
between Baker and Lincoln. It was a battle between
brilliancy and solidity. No man of his time surpassed Baker
in dashing eloquence. Handsome, of winning personality, he
was the idol of the young men of Springfield. Lincoln was
no longer, as at New Salem, the leader of the gang. His
alliance with aristocratic Mary Todd, the demands of his
profession and a settled life largely sundered the partnership.
It was a natural, not a sudden, intentional separation.
Strange rumors were afloat that he was no more a friend
to the lowly and that he was seeking new ways. Not free to
mingle with the people, he could not readily combat the suspicion.
And they were ever demanding a perfect embodiment
of their conception of heroism. They found it fully
in one of the most dramatic heroes and charming personalities
in the panorama of American politics&mdash;Edward D.
Baker.</p>

<p>When the friends of Baker first put forth the charge that
Lincoln belonged to a proud family, he was amused. He met
it with a laughing remark: "That sounds strange to me, for
I do not remember of but one who ever came to see me, and
while he was in town he was accused of stealing a Jew's
harp."<a name="FNanchor_185_188" id="FNanchor_185_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_188" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But as the campaign developed in intensity, and
he realized that the shameless report was scattered to his
harm, he thought bitterly of the false charge. The injustice
of the accusation and his incapacity to meet it, quite crushed
him. He could meet an open foe with a giant's strength,
but the gnat of malignant rumor defied him. Thus the
humblest politician that ever trod the soil of the Western
continent was not saved from the charge of being "puffed
up," and the leader of the lowly traveled in the domain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
bitter experience. The enthusiasm of the young men carried
the day for Baker in Sangamon County.</p>

<p>After his defeat, Lincoln took his old friend Jim Matheny
far into the woods. He unburdened himself, protesting that
he was anything but aristocratic and proud. "Why, Jim,"
he said, "I am now and always shall be the same Abe Lincoln
I was when you first saw me."<a name="FNanchor_186_189" id="FNanchor_186_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_189" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The story of the defeat as told by Lincoln to Speed, shows
much of his political training: "Baker beat me, and got the
delegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite
of my attempt to decline it, appointed me one of the delegates;
so that in getting Baker the nomination I shall be
fixed a good deal like a fellow who is made a groomsman
to a man who has cut him out and is marrying his own dear
'gal'."<a name="FNanchor_187_190" id="FNanchor_187_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_190" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Yet, Lincoln did not at once reconcile himself to the selection
of Baker. A letter from his friends in Menard County
led him still to contemplate possibilities and induced him to
skirmish on the frontier of his duty to the choice of Sangamon
County. He wrote to a supporter: "You say you shall
instruct your delegates for me unless I object. I certainly
shall not object. That would be too pleasant a compliment
for me to tread in the dust. And besides if anything should
happen (which, however, is not probable) by which Baker
should be thrown out of the fight, I would be at liberty to
accept the nomination if I could get it."<a name="FNanchor_188_191" id="FNanchor_188_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_191" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>In this same letter, he gave an account of the factors that
conspired to his defeat, saying that it would astonish the
older citizens to learn that he (uneducated, penniless boy,
working on a flatboat at $10.00 per month) had been put
down there as a candidate of pride and wealth; that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was, too, the strangest combination of church influence
against him; that Baker was a Campbellite, and with few
exceptions got all that church; that his wife had some relations
in the Presbyterian churches, and some with the Episcopal
churches, and wherever it would tell, he was set down
as either one or the other, while it was everywhere contended
that no Christian ought to go for him, because he belonged to
no church, was suspected of being a deist, and had talked
about fighting a duel.<a name="FNanchor_189_192" id="FNanchor_189_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_192" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> In the long letter Lincoln did not
even mention the personal strength and popularity of his
opponent, or suggest that Baker was the victor by his own
merit.</p>

<p>Though Lincoln returned to the practice of his profession
with increased devotion, he kept his interest in local and
national events. He still remained a student of the whims
of individual voters as well as a keen observer of political
affairs of general moment. A letter to Hardin at Washington
illustrates this: "Knowing that you have correspondents
enough, I have forborne to trouble you heretofore; and
I now only do so, to get you to set a matter right which has
got wrong with one of our best friends. It is old Uncle
Thomas Campbell of Spring Creek&mdash;(Berlin, P. O.). He has
received several documents from you, and he says that they
are old newspapers and documents, having no sort of interest
in them. He is, therefore, getting a strong impression that
you treat him with disrespect. This, I know, is a mistaken
impression; and you must correct it. The way, I leave to
yourself. Robert W. Canfield says that he would like to
have a document or two from you.</p>

<p>"The Locos here are in considerable trouble about Van
Buren's letter on Texas, and the Virginia electors. They are
growing sick of the Tariff question; and consequently are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
much confounded at V. B.'s cutting them off from the new
Texas question. Nearly half the leaders swear they won't
stand it."<a name="FNanchor_190_193" id="FNanchor_190_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_193" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>As early as 1837, Webster publicly declared that it could
not be disguised that a desire, or an intention, was already
manifested to annex Texas to the United States.<a name="FNanchor_191_194" id="FNanchor_191_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_194" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Under
the nursing of Tyler and Calhoun, a treaty of annexation
was concluded and the scheme almost consummated. The
Senate, in 1844, alone stood in the way. The proposal of
annexation overtopped all other issues in the campaign of
that year. It proved at the time a dominating incident and
left abundant traces on American history. Van Buren, rising
to the solitary eminence of statesmanship, uttered a firm
and subdued protest against the southern policy. But the
edict of the Calhoun democracy, that Texas must be annexed
was remorseless, and their old friend, Martin Van
Buren, in the homely language of Lincoln, was "turned out
to root."<a name="FNanchor_192_195" id="FNanchor_192_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_195" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> It proved the beginning of the cleft on the
slavery question that in less than twenty years hopelessly
divided the successors of the triumphant Jackson party.</p>

<p>In June, 1844, Clay fairly represented the views of the
Whigs declaring that the annexation of Texas, at this time,
without the consent of Mexico, as a measure compromising
the National character, involving war with Mexico, probably
with other foreign powers, dangerous to the integrity of the
Union, inexpedient in the present financial condition of the
country, was not called for by any general expression of
public opinion.<a name="FNanchor_193_196" id="FNanchor_193_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_196" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Later coquetting with southern sympathies
on this issue, he modified his opposition to the present
annexation of Texas with the fatal statement that he had no
hesitation in saying that, far from having any <i>personal</i> objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to the annexation of Texas, <i>he should be glad to see
it</i>&mdash;without dishonor, without war, with the common consent
of the Union and upon just and fair terms.<a name="FNanchor_194_197" id="FNanchor_194_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_197" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> This seeming
retreat, despite all explanation, insured his defeat. The diversion
gained him no strength in the South and alienated
needed support in the North.</p>

<p>The Southern States openly put forth their reasons for
annexation. To keep pace with the northern growth they
needed new States, otherwise they saw the doom of the institution
that they deemed the very palladium of their prosperity
and happiness. The unresting Calhoun finally triumphed
in awakening dormant fears and sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_195_198" id="FNanchor_195_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_198" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The main contention in the famous letter of Jackson was
better calculated, than this southern claim, to appeal to the
northern democracy, and was more in harmony with the
substantial trend of the national destiny. "I do not hesitate
to say that the welfare and happiness of our Union require
that it should be accepted. If, in a military point of view
alone, the question be examined, it will be found to be most
important to the United States to be in possession of the
territory.</p>

<p>"Great Britain has already made treaties with Texas;
and we know that far-seeing nation never omits a
circumstance, in her extensive intercourse with the world,
which can be turned to account in increasing her military
resources. May she not enter into an alliance with
Texas?"<a name="FNanchor_196_199" id="FNanchor_196_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_199" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>While the Texan issue stirred the Garrisonian Abolitionists,
it did not allay their hostility to organized political
action, they declared that they would open no road to political
preferment; that the strength of their cause was in the
humble, fervent prayer of the righteous man, which availeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
much, and the blessing of that God who had chosen the
weak things of the world to confound the mighty; that it
was to be expected that some political wolves would put on
the clothing of Abolitionism, and seek to elevate themselves
and manage the anti-slavery organization for their own purposes.<a name="FNanchor_D_200" id="FNanchor_D_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_200" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
The political Abolitionists, however, named James
G. Birney for President.</p>

<p>There was then, already, a complexity of opinion on the
slavery question that shadowed forth the future alignment of
parties. While many were confounded by wavering lights,
Lincoln picked his way with sure footed precision through
maze and pitfall. His unprejudiced mind wondered at the
conduct of the "Liberty men" that deprecating the annexation
of Texas, deliberately promoted its success by indirection.
Their application of the proposition "we are not to
do evil that good may come of it" he reduced to plain sophistry,
saying that if by their votes they could have prevented
the extension of slavery, it would have been good, and not
evil, so to have used their votes, even though it involved the
casting of them for a slaveholder, and he earnestly asked if
the fruit of electing Clay would have been to prevent the extension
of slavery, could the act of electing him have been
evil?<a name="FNanchor_197_201" id="FNanchor_197_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_201" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He held that it was a paramount duty of the free
States to let the slavery of the other States alone, while it
was equally clear that they should never knowingly lend
themselves, directly or indirectly, to prevent slavery from
dying a natural death&mdash;to find new places for it to live in,
when it could no longer exist in the old.<a name="FNanchor_198_202" id="FNanchor_198_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_202" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Here, is clearly
announced the seeming paradox that, though slavery was an
evil, there still remained the duty to let it alone in the States
where it then existed. This further piles up evidence that
his views suffered little change with years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p><p>Lincoln boldly participated in the campaign of 1844; Clay
was the political hero of his youth and manhood as Washington
was of his boyhood. Like many other Whigs, he, too,
was enthralled by the magic of the far famed eloquence of
the name, that, in the words of the orator who nominated
Clay, expressed more enthusiasm, that it had in it more eloquence
than the names of Chatham, Burke, Patrick Henry,
and, more than any other and all other names together.<a name="FNanchor_199_203" id="FNanchor_199_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_203" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>During the campaign, Lincoln encountered his former employer,
John Calhoun, and other old antagonists. It is said
that Calhoun came nearer whipping Lincoln in debate than
Douglas did.<a name="FNanchor_200_204" id="FNanchor_200_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_204" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Nothing survives of those speeches. Still,
his enthusiasm and skill in the controversies of the campaign
awakened a demand for his services throughout the State.
His name as an orator even invaded Indiana. In the closing
hours of the contest his voice was heard on the soil that he
hastened from some fifteen years before as an adventurer.
While speaking at Gentryville, his old friend Nat Grigsby
entered the room. Lincoln stopped and crying out "There's
Nat," scrambled through the crowd to his modest associate
of former days. After greeting him warmly, he returned to
the platform. When the speech was done, he passed the rest
of the evening with Nat. Then Lincoln insisted that they
should sleep together; and long into the night, they talked
over old times and were once more Abe and Nat.<a name="FNanchor_201_205" id="FNanchor_201_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_205" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>The appearance of Clay's August letter stirred the political
Abolitionists to fateful activity. They insisted that his
antagonism to annexation, not being founded on anti-slavery
convictions, was of no account.<a name="FNanchor_202_206" id="FNanchor_202_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_206" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> They polled enough votes
to elect pro-slavery Polk. Mingled with the ribaldry, the
din and howl of abandoned politicians over the election of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Polk, were the exultant shouts of the sober and respectable
men of the Liberty Party. They celebrated in unison the
victory they both promoted.</p>

<p>The solemn selection of James K. Polk instead of Henry
Clay as President, was a discordant incident that the Whig
patriot did not linger over willingly. That a pigmy should
sit in the seat of the statesman, that a puppet should stand
in the place of the nature-dowered son of American policies,&mdash;this
opinion made Clay's followers doubt the wisdom of
republican government. To them this defeat was more than
a partisan grief, it was a national loss. From loyal supporters
hurried a grand tribute to their uncrowned champion in
his retreat: "We will remember you, Henry Clay, while the
memory of the glorious or the sense of the good remains in
us, with a grateful and admiring affection which shall
strengthen with our strength and shall not decline with our
decline. We will remember you in all our future trials and
reverses as him whose name honored defeat and gave it a
glory which victory could not have brought. We will remember
you when patriotic hope rallies again to successful
contest with the agencies of corruption and ruin; for we
will never know a triumph which you do not share in life,
whose glory does not accrue to you in death."<a name="FNanchor_203_207" id="FNanchor_203_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_207" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>LINCOLN OPPOSES THE INCEPTION OF THE MEXICAN WAR IN
CONGRESS</h3>

<p>It is quite generally believed in Sangamon County that a
bargain was entered into between Baker, Lincoln, Logan
and Hardin whereby the "four should 'rotate' in Congress
until each had had a term."<a name="FNanchor_204_208" id="FNanchor_204_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_208" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> There is evidence in the writings
of Lincoln that there was some kind of an understanding
between Baker, Lincoln and Logan. There is a startling
story as to the character of the arrangement. A delegate
to the Pekin Convention of 1843 states, that he was asked
by Lincoln immediately after the nomination of Hardin, if
he would favor a resolution recommending Baker for the
next term. On being answered in the affirmative Lincoln
told the delegate to prepare the resolution, and he would
support it. It created a profound sensation, especially
among the friends of Hardin. After angry discussion, the
resolution passed by a bare majority.<a name="FNanchor_205_209" id="FNanchor_205_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_209" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> This incident illustrates
the sagacious policy of Lincoln in furthering his restless
political ambition. He publicly declined to contest the
nomination of Baker in 1844. Pursuant to a widespread
expectation, Baker did not stand in the way of Lincoln two
years later.</p>

<p>Lincoln kept close to those who moulded public opinion,&mdash;the
men of the press. Then the personality of an editor was
a weighty factor in the decision of political contests. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
wrote to an editor and supporter in 1846 that as the paper
at Pekin had nominated Hardin for governor and the Alton
paper indirectly nominated him for Congress, it would give
Hardin a great start, and perhaps use him up, if the Whig
papers of the district should nominate Hardin for Congress,
and that he wished that the editor would let nothing appear
in his paper which might operate against him.<a name="FNanchor_206_210" id="FNanchor_206_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_210" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>To this, he received a reply that this supporter had, in
fact, nominated Hardin for governor. The tactful response
deserves attention: "Let me assure you that if there is anything
in my letter indicating an opinion that the nomination
for governor, which I supposed to have been made in the
Pekin paper, was operating or could operate against me,
such was not my meaning. Now that I know that nomination
was made by you, I say that it may do me good, while I do
not see that it can do me harm. But, while the subject is in
agitation, should any of the papers in the district nominate
the same man for Congress, that would do me harm; and it
was that which I wished to guard against. Let me assure
you that I do not for a moment suppose that what you have
done is ill-judged, or that anything that you shall do will
be."<a name="FNanchor_207_211" id="FNanchor_207_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_211" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>"I should be pleased," he wrote another friend, "if I could
concur with you in the hope that my name would be the only
one presented to the convention; but I cannot. Hardin
is a man of desperate energy and perseverance, and one that
never backs out; and I fear, to think otherwise is to be deceived
in the character of our adversary. I would rejoice
to be spared the labor of a contest; but 'being in', I shall
go it thoroughly, and to the bottom." He then admonished
his friend not to relax any of his vigilance.<a name="FNanchor_208_212" id="FNanchor_208_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_212" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>He was sensitive to the shifting changes of the campaign.
"Nathan Dresser is here," he wrote a friend, "and speaks as
though the contest between Hardin and me is to be doubtful
in Menard County.&mdash;I know he is candid and this alarms
me some&mdash;I asked him to tell me the names of the men that
were going strong for Hardin; he said Morris was about as
strong as any&mdash;Now, tell me, is Morris going it openly?
You remember you wrote me, that he would be neutral.
Nathan also said that some man he could not remember had
said lately that Menard County was going to decide the
contest and that that made the contest very doubtful. Do
you know who that was?</p>

<p>"Don't fail to write me instantly on receiving telling me all&mdash;particularly
the names of those who are going strong
against me."<a name="FNanchor_209_213" id="FNanchor_209_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_213" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The splendid generalship of Lincoln, his telling blows
gradually disposed of the gallant Hardin, who gracefully
declined to be longer considered as a candidate. Through the
inspiration of Lincoln, with equal gallantry, there promptly
appeared in the leading Whig journal, a statement superbly
designed to soothe the dignity of his late antagonist: "We
have had, and now have, no doubt that he (Hardin) has been,
and now is, a great favorite with the Whigs of the district.
He states, in substance, that there was never any understanding
on his part that his name was not to be presented
in the canvasses of 1844 and 1846. This, we believe, is
strictly true. Still, the doings of the Pekin Convention did
seem to point that way; and the general's voluntary declination
as to the canvass of 1844 was by many construed into
an acquiescence on his part. These things had led many
of his most devoted friends to not expect him to be a candidate
at this time. Add to this the relation that Mr. Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
bears, and has borne, to the party, and it is not strange
that many of those who are as strongly devoted to Gen. Hardin
as they are to Mr. Lincoln should prefer the latter at
this time. We do not entertain a doubt, that, if we could
reverse the positions of the two men, that a very large portion
of those who now have supported Mr. Lincoln most
warmly would have supported Gen. Hardin quite as
warmly."<a name="FNanchor_210_214" id="FNanchor_210_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_214" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>He was a thorough politician. He attended to details
himself. Like a general on the battlefield, he kept his reserve
forces well in hand. He would rather minimize his own
strength than mistake the power of opposing forces. He
never lost a victory through misplaced confidence. Though
he looked darkly at a contest, this rather increased than
abated his activity. From policy as well as inclination he
did not engage in the crimination of his adversaries. He
had a marvelous capacity of personally commanding the conduct
of men.</p>

<p>Out of their ranks, the Democrats called the famed
preacher&mdash;Peter Cartwright, as their standard bearer in this
Congressional contest. Until he was sixteen years old, he
was a slave to the common vices of his day. His dramatic
conversion during the revival of 1801 preluded the marvelous
career of a man who unflinchingly, for sixty years, "breasted
the storm and suffered the hardships" of his calling in forest
and prairie. His heroic treatment of Jackson shows the
man. "Just then," Cartwright says, "I felt some one pull
my coat in the stand, and turning my head, my fastidious
preacher, whispering a little loud, said: 'General Jackson
has come in: General Jackson has come in.' I felt a flash
of indignation run all over me like an electric shock and
facing about to my congregation, and purposely speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
out audibly, I said, 'Who is General Jackson? If he don't
get his soul converted, God will damn him as quick as he
would a Guinea negro!'"<a name="FNanchor_211_215" id="FNanchor_211_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_215" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The reasons that prompted Cartwright to follow the trail
from Kentucky to Illinois are of historical importance.
"First, I would get entirely clear of the evil of slavery.
Second, I could raise my children to work where work was
not considered a degradation. Third, I believed I could better
my temporal circumstances, and procure lands for my
children as they grew up. And fourth, I could carry the
gospel to destitute souls that had, by their removal into
some new country, been deprived of the means of grace."<a name="FNanchor_212_216" id="FNanchor_212_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_216" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
The South poorly reckoned the cost to her, of the institution
that drove into exile such master spirits, who enriched the
states of their adoption.</p>

<p>Hating human bondage, still he was no friend of abolitionism.
He declared that it riveted the chains of slavery tighter;
blocked the way to reasonable emancipation; threw fire
brands into legislative halls; that millions were expended
every year in angry debates and that laws for the good of
the people were neglected; talents and money thrown away;
that prejudice, strife, and wrath, and every evil passion
stirred up until the integrity of the Union was in imminent
danger, and that not one poor slave was set free; not one
dollar expended to colonize them and send them home happy
and free; that through unchristian, excited prejudices mobs
were fast becoming the order of the day.</p>

<p>He maintained that after more than twenty years' experience
as a traveling preacher in slave states, he was convinced
that the most successful way to ameliorate the condition
of the slaves and Christianize them, and finally secure
their freedom was to treat their owners kindly and not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
meddle politically with slavery!</p>

<p>Patriot and prophet alike, he contended that abolitionism
awakened a bitter and wrathful spirit among the guardians
of the black man that made discord a partner in the Federal
Union; that despite the legion moral evils of slavery, he had
never seen a rabid abolition or free soil society that he
could join, because they resorted to unjustifiable agitation,
confounding the innocent with the guilty, and that if force
was resorted to the Union would be dissolved, a civil war
would follow, death and carnage would ensue, and the only
free nation on the earth would be destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_213_217" id="FNanchor_213_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_217" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> In early
manhood, Cartwright cherished sentiments that were brother
to those Lincoln later avowed at the outset of his career.</p>

<p>In his autobiography, Cartwright states that he was twice
elected as a representative from Sangamon County, and he
found that almost every measure had to be carried by a corrupt
bargain and sale.<a name="FNanchor_214_218" id="FNanchor_214_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_218" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>For nearly half a century he had traversed the western
states. In nearly every Methodist Church and mission his
voice had summoned many to a better life. His ministration
to the sick, his rides at night over the lonely prairie to the
death bed had endeared him to thousands of homes. He
had a host of relations in the Congressional district. All
this and his steady advocacy of Jacksonian Democracy constituted
him no paltry antagonist.</p>

<p>An active campaign ensued. Lincoln was again subjected
to the harsh charge of religious infidelity. The Whigs,
taking up the challenge rallied to his support. Their activity
soon turned the tide. Lincoln carried the district by
1511, exceeding the vote of Clay in 1844 by nearly 600.
Sangamon County showed her loyalty by piling up a larger
majority than ever before given to a political favorite.<a name="FNanchor_215_219" id="FNanchor_215_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_219" class="fnanchor">[215]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
The battle largely centered around the wisdom of a preacher
participating in politics. The pioneer, who twenty years
before, had voted for Cartwright had now become a citizen
of a settled community. After this election, there was no
question as to the deep seated distrust of the average voter
permitting a church official to be the political representative
of the people.</p>

<p>A Democrat who loathed the canvass of Cartwright still
deemed it a hard thing to vote against his party. So Lincoln
told him that he would give him a candid opinion as
to whether the vote was needed or not. On the day of election,
Lincoln told the Democrat that he had got the preacher,&mdash;and
didn't want his vote.<a name="FNanchor_216_220" id="FNanchor_216_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_220" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> With this power to foretell
results, Lincoln was more richly dowered than any modern
leader. It was this gift that enabled him to do and speak
things that to other men seemed ruinous.</p>

<p>The victory of Polk in its immediate results hardly surprised
friend or foe. His election was the signal gun of the
Mexican war. Events were rapidly hurried forward under
the fostering guidance of the Tyler administration and in
its last gasp a messenger was dispatched to Texas to mature
the annexation.<a name="FNanchor_217_221" id="FNanchor_217_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_221" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In weighty words Greeley uttered the
protest of the aroused North, declaring that the annexation
of Texas challenged the regard of mankind and defied the
consciences of our own citizens; that for the first time our
Union stood before the nations, not merely as an upholder,
but as a zealous, unscrupulous propagandist of human slavery.<a name="FNanchor_218_222" id="FNanchor_218_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_222" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
It required no special genius to provoke martial
hostilities and anxiety soon found ammunition to drive even
a reluctant opponent to the chance of battle. So Mexico
was almost dared into the inevitable combat.</p>

<p>Until this time the nation was little stirred by political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
unrest and strife. The battles in Congress that form so vast
an asset of the historian, hardly disturbed the daily life
of the inventor, farmer, mechanic and student. Lincoln
entered the national Legislature at a momentous period. For
more than a third of a century, "grim visaged war had
smoothed her wrinkled front." The nation was lost in industrial
pursuits, the hero of the community was the business
man. Patriotism slumbered, national impulses seemed dead.
Then the wild passion for war awakened the people from
apathy, they rejoiced that the spirit of the fathers was still
strong in them, that they had not forgotten Bunker Hill
and New Orleans. Commerce for the time forewent its eminence,
the soldier stepped to the front. In a moment the
standard of the nation shifted from the dollar to the deed.
Men did not stop to debate the righteousness of the war or
what the end would be. They did not reason as to its effect
on the status of slavery. Emotion, not judgment, was their
guide. They knew only the pulsation of a subtle and subduing
patriotism. Many marched to the front, while others
hurried on supplies and ammunition to the seat of trouble.
The present alone absorbed their interest, busied every impulse.</p>

<p>Lincoln did not willingly come into conflict with this public
sentiment. He, too, was moved by the heroism of the hour,
he too saw with pride the flag unfurled and heard the throbbing
drum. When Hardin and Baker and Shields hastened
from Springfield for the field of glory and danger, he was
one of the speakers at the parting public meeting. The
Congressman-elect urged a sturdy, vigorous prosecution of
hostilities, admonished all to permit no shame to the government
and to stand by the flag till peace came with honor.<a name="FNanchor_219_223" id="FNanchor_219_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_223" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
This was not a reluctant politic approbation, as Lamon intimates,<a name="FNanchor_220_224" id="FNanchor_220_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_224" class="fnanchor">[220]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
but a benediction upon the cause of his country
that came deep from the heart.</p>

<p>The attitude of Lincoln toward the annexation of Texas
is of importance, not alone for its own intrinsic interest but
as illustrating the opinion of thousands of sober, patriotic
citizens throughout the land. These had no kinship with
the radicals who regarded the conduct of the war, as well
as its inception, with bitter hostility; who feared the visitation
of Divine Power upon a conflict conceived in aggression.
They were not akin to the Democrats who looked neither to
the right nor left but marched over cherished principles of
the Republic for the sake of extending the territory and enlarging
the activity of a sectional institution.</p>

<p>Lincoln entered Congress with no thought of opposition
to any phase of the war. Like Grant, he doubtless knew that
the man who criticized a war in which his nation is engaged,
no matter whether right or wrong, occupies no enviable
place in life or history, and that he might better advocate
"war, pestilence and famine," than to act as an obstructionist
to a war already begun.<a name="FNanchor_221_225" id="FNanchor_221_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_225" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The President and his advisors would not allow the Whigs
to vote alone for supplies. They sought to interpolate resolutions
expressing the original justice of the war. Lincoln's
interesting commentary on this uncalled for procedure is
worth quoting. "Upon these resolutions when they shall be
put on their passage I shall be compelled to vote; so that
I cannot be silent if I would. Seeing this, I went about
preparing myself to give the vote understandingly when it
should come. I carefully examined the President's message,
to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the
point. The result of this examination was to make the
impression that, taking for true all the President states as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
facts, he falls far short of proving his justification; and
that the President would have gone farther with his proof if
it had not been for the small matter that the truth would
not permit him. Under the impression thus made I gave the
vote before mentioned."<a name="FNanchor_222_226" id="FNanchor_222_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_226" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The issue once made, Lincoln and other Whigs did not
hesitate; he did not even hide in silence. He took up the
challenge of the President that war existed by the act of
Mexico. He followed with probing resolutions, with a series
of penetrating questions that precluded quibbling. The first
one well illustrates the series.</p>

<p>"RESOLVED, By the House of Representatives, that the
President of the United States be respectfully requested to
inform the House&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens
was shed, as in his message declared, was or was not within
the territory of Spain, at least after the treaty of 1819
until the Mexican revolution."<a name="FNanchor_E_227" id="FNanchor_E_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_227" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>The President never heeded them, nor does it appear that
any friend of the administration soberly attempted the sore
task of facing their keen, sabre-like stroke. They allowed
little room for shifting, and demanded a logical response.
Three weeks later, came the speech which was responsive to
the desire of his Springfield friends to distinguish himself.<a name="FNanchor_223_228" id="FNanchor_223_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_228" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
It was sober and restrained in expression; curbed in statement,
concise in logic and comprehensive in treatment. He
spoke more like a distinguished jurist than a partisan
pleader.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence
as to whether Texas had actually carried her revolution
to the place where the hostilities of the present war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
commenced, let the President answer the interrogatories I
proposed, as before mentioned, or some other similar ones.
Let him answer fully, fairly and candidly. Let him answer
with facts and not with arguments. Let him remember he
sits where Washington sat and so remembering, let him answer
as Washington would answer. As a nation should not,
and the Almighty will not, be evaded, so let him attempt no
evasion&mdash;no equivocation. And if, so answering, he can
show that the soil was ours where the first blood of the war
was shed,&mdash;then I am with him for his justification."<a name="FNanchor_224_229" id="FNanchor_224_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_229" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Then
a sentence follows, painful and remorseless in its treatment
of the vacillating policy of the President stating that his
mind, taxed beyond its power, was running hither and thither,
like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding no
position on which it could settle down and be at ease.<a name="FNanchor_225_230" id="FNanchor_225_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_230" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>This speech should have won him a high place in the national
arena of controversy and debate, were it not that the
shifting standard of public judgment often exalts the thing
of the hour for intrinsic value, ostentation for merit, popularity
for worth. This speech may in itself command the
interest of those who would know the motives that led the
Whigs to their course of conduct. They did not seek hard
duties, but still they would not shirk or retreat when they
showed their front.</p>

<p>Lincoln soon learned that his resolutions and speech, however
unanswerable, did not save him from the damaging
charge of opposition to the war of his country. Dissatisfaction
ran through the Whig ranks in Illinois. General discontent
with the course of his partner even turned Herndon
into one of the malcontents. A letter soon advised Lincoln
of the condition, who sent a sturdy reply to the complaint
on his vote on Ashmun's amendment,&mdash;"That vote affirms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced
by the President; and I will stake my life that if you
had been in my place you would have voted just as I did.
Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie?
I know you would not. Would you have gone out of the
House&mdash;skulked the vote? I expect not.&mdash;You are compelled
to speak, and your only alternative is to tell the truth
or a lie. I cannot doubt which you would do."<a name="FNanchor_226_231" id="FNanchor_226_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_231" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Later Herndon forwarded a constitutional argument in
favor of the policy of Polk ingeniously saying that it was
the duty of the President as Commander-in-Chief of the army
and navy, in the absence of Congress, if the country was
about to be invaded, to go, if necessary, into the very heart
of Mexico and prevent the invasion; that it would be a
crime in the executive to let the country be invaded in the
least degree; that the action of the President was a necessity.<a name="FNanchor_227_232" id="FNanchor_227_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_232" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>The reply that hurried to Springfield was a supreme answer.
No judge of a high tribunal, no statesman of mature
experience could have more thoroughly disposed of a specious
contention.<a name="FNanchor_228_233" id="FNanchor_228_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_233" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> In this letter of Lincoln there appears a might
and an ability to grapple with a great issue, a sincerity
of purpose, a soberness of thought that well betokens a
student and patriot, whose heart was in unison with the inherent
purposes of the Republic. He insisted that the imperial
function of the Constitution in leaving the declaration
of war with Congress was that no one man should hold
the power of bringing the oppression of war upon the people.<a name="FNanchor_229_234" id="FNanchor_229_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_234" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Through this letter there looms up the man, who
above all men hated kingly power and domination, and the
consequent impoverishment of the people. Herndon, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Abolitionist, would, for the sake of policy, sanction the inception
of an unjust aggression, while the conservative Lincoln
stood resolutely when the hour summoned uncompromising
conduct; then his knees were as "unwedgeable as the gnarled
oak." When principle was at stake he sent policy to the
rear. At such times he was more aggressive than the radical.</p>

<p>A letter to the Editor of the <i>Tribune</i> shows the deep hold
that this subject had on Lincoln, his restlessness to be rightly
understood on the theme. And the fact that he undertook
to correct Horace Greeley in a familiar tone is an indication
that he was coming to the front as a champion in the
Whig ranks. He wrote the editor that he discovered a paragraph
in the <i>Tribune</i> in which it was said that all Whigs
and many Democrats contended that the boundary of Texas
stopped at the Nueces. He contended that such a statement
was a mistake which he disliked to see go uncorrected
in a leading Whig paper; that the large majority of Whigs
in the House of Representatives had not taken that position
and that as the position could not be maintained it gave
the Democrats advantage of them. In conclusion Lincoln
asked the editor to examine what he said in a printed speech
that he was sending him.<a name="FNanchor_230_235" id="FNanchor_230_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_235" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>He earnestly wrote to a minister that he would be obliged
for a reference to any law, human or divine, in which an
authority could be found for saying that the action of the
Government constituted "no aggression." He then asked,
"Is the precept 'Whatsoever ye would that men should do to
you, do ye even so to them' obsolete? of no force? of no
application?"<a name="FNanchor_231_236" id="FNanchor_231_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_236" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>He was not so elated with patriotism that he lost his
standard of righteousness. As he was an honest judge of
his own conduct, so he was of that of his country. This rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
ability became a force of moment in later years.</p>

<p>During the tumult of the debate on the Mexican war
Lincoln wrote in his own rare way that Stephens, of Georgia,
a little slim, pale-faced, consumptive man, with a voice like
Logan's, had just concluded the very best speech of an
hour's length he ever heard; that his old withered dry eyes
were full of tears yet.<a name="FNanchor_232_237" id="FNanchor_232_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_237" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>His appreciation knew no sectional limits. His range
of vision was not bounded by the Mason and Dixon line. He
was as much at home with the sons of the South as of the
North; he took the same interest in the speech of Stephens
of Georgia as he would in that of Webster.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>LINCOLN'S ATTACK ON SLAVERY IN CONGRESS</h3>


<p>Lincoln's main assignment in congressional committee
work was on Post-office and Post-roads. He plodded
through the detail duties with industry. There was no more
earnest worker in the ranks of Congress. On an important
occasion, Lincoln stood by the Democratic Postmaster General,
and opposed the policy of the Whig members of the
Committee. He worked out a painstaking plan for certain
postmasters receiving subscriptions for newspapers and periodicals.
He declared it to be in accordance with republican
institutions, which could be best sustained by the diffusion
of knowledge and the due encouragement of a universal, national
spirit of inquiry and discussion of public events
through the medium of the public press.<a name="FNanchor_233_238" id="FNanchor_233_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_238" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln prepared himself thoroughly in the logic of protection
to American industries. He advanced considerably
in a serious understanding of its fundamental importance.
Not satisfied with old and common contention, he sounded
the depths of discussion, by his quaint and original method.</p>

<p>He had intense sympathy for the toiler. He deemed a
wise and just distribution of wealth a national duty. He
pronounced that rather than production the deeper object
of government. "And inasmuch," he said, "as most good
things are produced by labor, it follows that all such things
of right belong to those whose labor has produced them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
But it has so happened, in all ages of the world, that some
have labored, and others have without labor enjoyed a large
proportion of the fruits. That is wrong, and should not
continue. To secure to each laborer the whole product of
his labor, or as nearly as possible, is a worthy object of
any good government."<a name="FNanchor_234_239" id="FNanchor_234_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_239" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>He was in advance of the thought of his day in insisting
that all transportation, commerce, distribution, not essential,
was a heavy pensioner upon industry, depriving it of
a large proportion of its just fruits. He advocated the
remedy of driving useless toil and idleness out of existence.
He announced that all work done directly or indirectly in
carrying articles to the place of consumption, which could
have been produced in sufficient abundance, with as little
effort at the place of consumption as at the place they were
carried from, was useless labor.<a name="FNanchor_235_240" id="FNanchor_235_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_240" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> These fragments show
the intellectual power of a growing man of fine sympathies,
the sound conviction of a benefactor of his kind.</p>

<p>That Lincoln rapidly adapted himself to the ways of
Congress appears from the variety of the subjects he discussed.
Few of the new comers were more in evidence. His
speech on internal improvements reveal the secret of his
power. He sought no name to sanction his opinions, he used
his own illustrations and reached his conclusions unaided. He
attacked the opinions of those high in power and station.
President Polk maintained that the burden of improvements
would be general while the benefits would be local, thus involving
a pernicious inequality. The reply of Lincoln is
a sign of his political wisdom. He argued that inequality
was never to be embraced for its own sake; but that if every
good thing was to be discarded which might be inseparably
connected with some degree of inequality, then all government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
would have to be discarded. The Capitol, he continued,
was built at the public expense, but still it was of some
peculiar local advantage, and to make sure of all inequality
Congress would have to hold its sessions, as the loafer lodged,
"in spots about." He added that there were few stronger
cases in this world of "burden to the many and benefit to the
few," of "inequality," than the Presidency itself; that an
honest laborer dug coal at about seventy cents a day, while
the President dug abstractions at about Seventy Dollars a
day, and the coal was clearly worth more than the abstractions.
He declared that the true rule, in determining
whether to embrace or reject anything, was not whether it
had any evil in it, but whether it had more of evil than of
good; that almost everything, especially of government policy,
was an inseparable compound of the two; so that the
best judgment of the preponderance between them was continually
demanded.<a name="FNanchor_236_241" id="FNanchor_236_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_241" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>A great national party witnessed only the malign consequences
of the internal improvement policy. To avoid its
abuse, they practically advocated its abatement. Seeing only
the danger of extravagance, the Democratic party was not
free to contemplate prudent expenditures. Lincoln with his
keen sight presented a solution indicative of statesmanship.
His plan permitted the States working in a smaller
sphere of activity in local improvements to cross paths and
to work together in larger national matters under the guidance
of sober and restrained general legislation, based on
statistical information.</p>

<p>The keen, shrewd instinct of the politician in Lincoln
shows through his strenuous advocacy of General Taylor as
the Whig candidate for the Presidency. He was in the van in
fighting opposition in Illinois to the silent soldier and untried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
statesman. In April he wrote his friend Washburne
to let nothing discourage or baffle him, but, in spite of every
difficulty, to send a good Taylor delegate from his circuit,
and to make Baker, who was a good hand to raise a breeze,
to help about it.<a name="FNanchor_237_242" id="FNanchor_237_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_242" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> On the same day he admonished another
associate in his inimitable manner. "I know our good friend
Browning is a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and I therefore
fear he is favoring his nomination. If he is, ask him to
discard feeling, and try if he can possibly, as a matter of
judgment, count the votes necessary to elect him.</p>

<p>"In my judgment we can elect nobody but General Taylor;
but we cannot elect him without a nomination. Therefore,
don't fail to send a delegate."<a name="FNanchor_238_243" id="FNanchor_238_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_243" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>His admiration for Clay was subdued in his zeal for political
success. He would not do honor to the statesman as an
idle tribute so he would put him aside and call to the leadership
of the Whig party a man whose strength was largely in
the uncertainty of his views, in silence not in known sincerity.
He saw its cause could triumph with Taylor; that
the extension of the slave power was more likely to come
from the northern non-slave-holding Cass than from the
southern slave-holding Taylor. To still further confound
the jumble, the Whig convention avoided annunciation of
distinctive principles, and even dared to vote down an affirmance
of the Wilmot Proviso.<a name="FNanchor_239_244" id="FNanchor_239_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_244" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> After the selection of "Old
Rough," with Stephens, Toombs and Preston, he continued
an aggressive interest in his candidacy.<a name="FNanchor_240_245" id="FNanchor_240_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_245" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> He again pleaded
with his friends for support from his State.</p>

<p>"By many, and often, it has been said they would not
abide the nomination of Taylor; but since the deed has been
done, they are fast falling in, and in my opinion we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
have a most overwhelming glorious triumph. One unmistakable
sign is that all the odds and ends are with us&mdash;Barburners,
Native Americans, Tyler men, disappointed
office-seeking Locofocos, and the Lord knows what. This is
important, if in nothing else, in showing which way the wind
blows. Some of the sanguine men have set down all the states
as certain for Taylor but Illinois, and it as doubtful. Cannot
something be done even in Illinois? Taylor's nomination
takes the Locos on the blind side. It turns the war thunder
against them. The war is now to them the gallows of Haman,
which they built for us, and upon which they are doomed to
be hanged themselves."<a name="FNanchor_241_246" id="FNanchor_241_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_246" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>According to a peculiar and prevalent method in the
House, of spending public money for personal or partisan
purposes, Lincoln availed himself of the privilege of making
a campaign speech. It has met with varied comment.
Lamon freely and soberly passes this judgment. "Few like
it have ever been heard in either of those venerable chambers.
It is a common remark of those who know nothing of the
subject, that Mr. Lincoln was devoid of imagination; but
the reader of this speech will entertain a different opinion.
It opens to us a mind fertile in images sufficiently rare and
striking, but of somewhat questionable taste. It must have
been heard in amazement by those gentlemen of the House
who had never known a Hanks, or seen a New Salem."<a name="FNanchor_242_247" id="FNanchor_242_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_247" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Herndon, twenty years later, pronounced it a masterpiece
and declared that one who would read it would lay it down
convinced that Lincoln's ascendency for a quarter of a century
among the political spirits in Illinois was by no means
an accident, and would not wonder that Douglas, with all
his forensic ability, averted, as long as he could, a contest
with a man whose plain, analytical reasoning was not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
potent than his mingled drollery and caricature were
effective.<a name="FNanchor_F_248" id="FNanchor_F_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_248" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln entered on the <i>hard job</i> of showing that it was
sound doctrine for the President to shun defined public opinions
and allow Congress its own way without hindrance from
the chief executive. The history of the United States has
been a vigorous answer to this contention. As President he
made short shrift of that policy, though his splendid statement
of the Whig position may well attract more than passing
attention. He maintained that the Democrats were in
favor of laying down in advance a platform as a unit, and
then of forcing the people to ratify all of its provisions,
however unpalatable some of them might be; that the Whigs
were in favor of making Presidential elections, and the legislation
of the country distinct matters; so that the people
could elect whom they pleased, and afterwards legislate just
as they pleased. The difference, he insisted, was as clear as
noon day, and that leaving the People's business in their
hands was the true Republican position.<a name="FNanchor_243_249" id="FNanchor_243_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_249" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>No more dramatic attack during the entire session, arraigning
the Democratic candidate was made than in this
speech for his attitude on the Wilmot resolution. "In 1846,"
says Lincoln, "General Cass was for the proviso at once;
that in March, 1847, he was still for it, but not just then;
and that in December, 1847, he was against it altogether.
This is a true index to the whole man. When the question
was raised in 1846, he was in a blustering hurry to take
ground for it. He sought to be in advance, and to avoid the
uninteresting position of a mere follower; but soon he began
to see glimpses of the great Democratic ox-goad waving in
his face, and to hear indistinctly, a voice saying, 'Back!
Back, sir! Back a little!' He shakes his head and bats his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
eyes, and blunders back to his position of March, 1847; but
still the goad waves, and the voice grows more distinct and
sharper still, 'Back, sir, Back, I say! Further back!'&mdash;and
back he goes to the position of December, 1847, at which
the goad is still, and the voice soothingly says, 'So! Stand
at that!'"<a name="FNanchor_G_250" id="FNanchor_G_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_250" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>That Lincoln had not fully forgotten the form of utterance
that angered Darbey and has bothered most biographers
since, appears in the following selection: "Like a
horde of hungry ticks you have stuck to the tail of the
Hermitage lion to the end of his life; and you are still sticking
to it, and drawing a loathsome sustenance from it, after
he is dead. A fellow once advertised that he had made a
discovery by which he could make a new man out of an old
one, and have enough of the stuff left to make a little yellow
dog. Just such a discovery has General Jackson's popularity
been to you. You not only twice made President out
of him out of it, but you have had enough of the stuff left
to make Presidents of several comparatively small men since;
and it is your chief reliance now to make still another."<a name="FNanchor_244_251" id="FNanchor_244_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_251" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>At least it may be said that he was not the aggressor or
the sole participant in such a "scathing and withering
style,"<a name="FNanchor_245_252" id="FNanchor_245_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_252" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> nor is it at all hard to find like statements and
oratory in every period of our history. This is almost the
last time that the historian need halt in his comment on
the expression of Lincoln. Years of experience brought him
to a higher conception of public utterances. When the subject
matter bade exalted expression he grew to the occasion
with amazing avidity.</p>

<p>This speech revealed Lincoln to Congress. It gained prestige
among the fulminations of the session. The <i>Baltimore American</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
named it the "crack speech of the day." It labeled
Lincoln as a very able, acute, uncouth, honest, upright man
and a tremendous, wag withal.<a name="FNanchor_246_253" id="FNanchor_246_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_253" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>His reputation as a Congressman and orator, begot him
the honorable privilege of addressing in September, the same
audience in the east that often listened to the triumphant
Webster. Only a faint echo of these speeches of the Illinois
representative remains.</p>

<p>A representative Boston newspaper reports him as saying
that the people of Illinois agreed entirely with the people
in Massachusetts on the slavery question, except, that they
did not think about it as constantly; that all agreed that
slavery was an evil, which could not be affected in the slave
states; but that the question of the <i>extension</i> of slavery to
new territories was under control. In opposition to this
extension Lincoln believed that the self-named "Free Soil"
party was far behind the Whigs; that the "Free Soil" men
in claiming that name, indirectly attempted a deception, by
implying that Whigs were not free soil men; that in declaring
that they would "do their duty and leave the consequences
to God," merely gave an excuse for taking a course
they were not able to maintain by fair argument. Making
this declaration, he further argued, did not show what their
duty was, that if it did there would be no use for judgment;
that men might as well be made without intellect, and when
divine or human law did not clearly point their duty, they
had no means of finding out what it was by using their most
intellectual judgment of the consequences, and that if there
were divine law or human law for voting for Martin Van
Buren, then he would give up the argument.<a name="FNanchor_247_254" id="FNanchor_247_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_254" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>New England testified to its liking for the western advocate
of Taylor. The <i>Boston Advertiser</i> stated that at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
close of his masterly speech, the audience gave three enthusiastic
cheers for Illinois, and three more for the eloquent
Whig member from that state.<a name="FNanchor_248_255" id="FNanchor_248_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_255" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> His Boston speech was so
effective "that several Whigs who had gone off on the 'Free
Soil' fizzle returned again to the Whig ranks."<a name="FNanchor_249_256" id="FNanchor_249_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_256" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Ida Tarbell contends that at this time Lincoln first experienced
the full meaning of the "Free Soil" sentiment,
as Massachusetts was then quivering under the impassioned
protests of the great Abolitionists, and Sumner
was beginning to devote his life to freedom and was speaking
often at riotous meetings. Miss Tarbell further maintains
Lincoln was sensitive to every shade of popular feeling
in New England, and was stirred as never before on the
question of slavery; that he heard Seward's speech in Tremont
Temple, and that night, as the two men sat talking,
said gravely to the great anti-slavery advocate:</p>

<p>"Governor Seward, I have been thinking about what you
said in your speech. I reckon you are right. We have got
to deal with this slavery question, and got to give much
more attention to it hereafter than we have been doing."<a name="FNanchor_250_257" id="FNanchor_250_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_257" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>This evidence does not prove that Lincoln then began to
take radical ground on the slavery question. Ten years before
in the Illinois Legislature, he made his protest, and
later at every opportunity when circumstances favored. His
hatred to slavery had long been kindled. He needed little
inspiration from the New York orator on New England soil
to start his indignation. His statement to Seward shows
that he was ready for radical conduct as soon as the event
permitted the onslaught. He rejoiced at the growth of the
public opinion that betokened the doom of the artificial
institution. But he did not need to sit at the feet of eastern
teachers. The New England trip was an incident, not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
epoch in his career.</p>

<p>The second session of this Congress was rather free from
turbulence. Lincoln was a silent spectator. He went with
his party on the main issues and voted for the Wilmot Proviso
"about 42 times."<a name="FNanchor_251_258" id="FNanchor_251_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_258" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The Northern Democrats in the
House returned in a resentful spirit at the support rendered
Taylor by eight slave states. They were not backward in
supporting legislation to exclude slavery from California
and New Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_252_259" id="FNanchor_252_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_259" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The Senate, true to its love of vested
interests speedily disposed of the proposal.</p>

<p>During the session a New York representative let loose a
resolution with the clanging preamble of a "law rooting out
the slave trade in the District of Columbia."<a name="FNanchor_253_260" id="FNanchor_253_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_260" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Lincoln was
one of three or four northern Whigs who voted to lay this
exuberant measure on the table.<a name="FNanchor_254_261" id="FNanchor_254_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_261" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>As the sole Whig representative of his State, coming from
a constituency hardly distinguished for its anti-slavery sentiments,
while most Whigs even from the New England states
were silent; no external duty beckoned him; no powerful organization
called him to ride the storm by branding the
jealous institution. Selfish ambition whispered prudence and
calmed the voice of protest.</p>

<p>But within the very shade of the Capitol, the slave girl
was coined into drachmas. He felt the world shame that had
come upon the nation by this blot on its professions. The
desire to strike another blow grew strong in him. As he
tried a decade before in the legislative halls of Illinois, so
now in the national assembly, in a very home of slavery, he
rang forth his hate of the old injustice. Still he did not give
way to an outburst of vengeance; he husbanded his anger;
thought only of the consequence, planned with wisdom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
most effective stab at the national disgrace.</p>

<p>The politician walked hand in hand with the patriot. He
gathered discordant elements to the support of a common
cause calling forth admiration at the unrivalled policy. He
consecrated to the high purpose of dedicating the national
Capitol to a free citizenship, a devotion and sagacity that
made him the peer of any strategist of his day. He conceived
and carried out a daring plan of securing the support
to his astounding proposal of the Mayor of Washington, a
representative of the intelligent slave-holding citizens of that
community. With equal skill, he secured the reinforcement
of the radical Giddings, who says in his diary that Lincoln's
bill to abolish slavery was approved by all; that he believed
it as good a bill as we could get at this time, and was willing
to pay for slaves in order to save them from the southern
market, as he supposed every man in the District would sell
his slaves if he saw that slavery was to be abolished.<a name="FNanchor_255_262" id="FNanchor_255_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_262" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
Lincoln held together two such leaders in advocacy of the
same measure affecting the sore subject, thus revealing the
supreme tactician, who in later years held to the public
service a Seward, a Stanton and a Chase in the same cabinet.</p>

<p>He persuaded the slave holder that it was wiser to adopt
his measure than in later years confront the danger of more
exacting legislation. He convinced the Abolitionists that
his law was the best then attainable. His alarming proposition
was as innocent in expression as patience and wisdom
could make it. It provided for the ultimate emancipation of
all slaves born after 1850 and the manumission of existing
slaves on full payment to willing owners. After soberly providing
for the return of all fugitive slaves the whole plan
was made dependent upon the approval of a popular vote.<a name="FNanchor_256_263" id="FNanchor_256_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_263" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>The slaveholders were more illiberal than the Abolitionists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
They spurned all compromise. They would admit no suggestion
that laid bare the injustice of their institution. They
knew that when an inroad was once made, its days would be
numbered; that compromise was the dawn of the end. They
brought all their power into being. The social influences of
Washington were called into polite requisition and the
Mayor, under this duress, withdrew his sanction.<a name="FNanchor_257_264" id="FNanchor_257_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_264" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The
biographers, who knew Lincoln in the days of trial, have
given expression to a splendid tribute to his constancy.
"Fifteen years afterwards, in the stress and tempest of a
terrible war, it was Mr. Lincoln's strange fortune to sign a
bill sent him by Congress for the abolition of slavery in
Washington; and perhaps the most remarkable thing about
the whole transaction was that while we were looking politically
upon a new heaven and a new earth,&mdash;for the vast
change in our moral and economical condition might justify
so audacious a phrase,&mdash;when there was scarcely a man
on the continent who had not greatly shifted his point of
view in a dozen years, there was so little change in Mr.
Lincoln. The same hatred of slavery, the same sympathy
with the slave, the same consideration for the slaveholder as
the victim of a system he had inherited, the same sense of
divided responsibility between the South and the North, the
same desire to effect great reforms with as little individual
damage and injury, as little disturbance of social conditions
as possible, were equally evident when the raw pioneer signed
the protest with Dan Stone of Vandalia, when the mature
man moved the resolution of 1849 in the Capitol and when
the President gave the sanction of his bold signature of the
act which swept away the slave shambles from the City of
Washington."<a name="FNanchor_258_265" id="FNanchor_258_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_265" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>He warred against slavery not the slave holder. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
full account of the conditions leading to the ownership of
human property. He realized that it was a legacy of a
former age, that it was not a product of present and individual
responsibility, that it was a national fault not a
private one, that the slave holder was the victim of the
system not the cause. So he would not have the change
come with a rush lest it might not be abiding. He was
willing to wait. Lincoln knew that progress is a slow and
labored process and that haste is often the companion of
reaction. He would awaken no just and general resentment,
a resentment that still lingers in the hearts of men from a
war-won emancipation. It would have been well for the
North and South had this measure of gradual compensated
emancipation have become the settled policy of the nation.
The most cankerous conflict of the age might have been
spared and the problems resulting therefrom less perplexing.
Like a wise surgeon, he dared an early operation rather than
delay the necessity of a more drastic remedy. When
passion forged to the front as the guide, when North and
South had ample occasion to dwell on mutual wrongs, when
the Constitution of the Union ceased to be the prevailing
measure of the individual and general welfare, the days of
peace were being numbered. Lincoln realized that compromise
is only available when wisely adapted to opposing forces
at the fitting time.</p>

<p>Thus, there stood forth in Congress a man who subdued
his passion for the Declaration of Independence and yet who
was not willing that the down-trodden should eternally remain
in the darkness of vicarious government. He knew
that slavery could not always dwell in the seat of government,
that the time would come when there would be no
human chattel on American soil. Still, Lincoln did not shift
to others the whole burden of bringing the day to pass, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
took his stand against the iniquity of human bondage with
sublime wisdom. He tempered but did not dull his sense of
justice. He struck a second blow at the national evil, a
sign that he still was true to his vow at New Orleans and
his protest at Vandalia.</p>

<p>Like other legislators, Lincoln was obliged to deal with
the issue of handing out offices as party spoil. Trade and
industry were still in their infancy and had not yet begun
to attract the activity of the aspiring. The highway to
general distinction and to honor was largely that of public
office. Hence, there ensued, in the words of Lincoln, a
"wriggle and struggle for office" and an effort to find "a way
to live without work."<a name="FNanchor_259_266" id="FNanchor_259_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_266" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>The attitude of Lincoln in days when the Jackson theory
was in its full vigor is noteworthy. As the sole Whig representative,
beside Colonel Baker, Lincoln asked, in 1849,
to be heard on all appointments in Illinois. His remarkable
action is seen in the following letter: "Mr. Bond I
know to be personally every way worthy of the office; and
he is very numerously and most respectably recommended.
His papers I send to you; and I solicit for his claims a full
and fair consideration. Having said this much, I add that
in my individual judgment the appointment of Mr. Thomas
would be better.... I add that from personal knowledge
I consider Mr. Bond every way worthy of the office, and
qualified to fill it. Holding the individual opinion that the
appointment of a different gentleman would be better, I ask
especial attention and consideration for his claim, and for
the opinions expressed in his favor by those over whom I can
claim no superiority."<a name="FNanchor_260_267" id="FNanchor_260_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_267" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> As Congressman he selected a
postman of a village with the same precision that he later
did a war minister.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>The activity of Lincoln in securing the nomination and
election of Taylor commanded the regard of some leading
politicians. They advised his candidacy for the General
Land Office. Lincoln was poorly equipped to seek the favor
of those dispensing patronage. He was not gifted with
assiduity or forwardness so often essential to bearing away
the palm. Seldom has a hunter for alluring official service
so gently put obstacles in the way of his success. Though
it is claimed he was even eager for the prize, he was careful
to a nicety, to avoid a false position, while others were bending
every effort and using every means at their disposal.</p>

<p>To several friends he wrote the following unique letter:
"Some months since I gave my word to secure the appointment
to that office of Mr. Cyrus Edwards, if in my power,
in a case of a vacancy; and more recently I stipulated with
Colonel Baker that if Mr. Edwards and Colonel J. L. D.
Morrison could arrange with each other for one of them to
withdraw, we would jointly recommend the other. In relation
to these pledges, I must not only be chaste, but above
suspicion. If the office shall be tendered to me, I must be
permitted to say: 'Give it to Mr. Edwards, or if so agreed
by them, to Colonel Morrison, and I decline it; if not, I
accept.' With this understanding you are at liberty to
procure me the offer of the appointment if you can; and I
shall feel complimented by your effort, and still more by its
success."<a name="FNanchor_261_268" id="FNanchor_261_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_268" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>But even his patience gave way when Justin Butterfield,
a late opponent of Taylor, was considered for the place.
He burst forth with the statement that if anything should
be given to the State, it should be so given as to gratify
friends, and to stimulate them to future exertions, and that
it would mortify him deeply if General Taylor's administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
should trample all his wishes in the dust merely to
gratify friends of Clay.<a name="FNanchor_262_269" id="FNanchor_262_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_269" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>It was not surprising that the laggard procedure of
Lincoln lost him this place. Political offices, like opportunity,
do not wait long. And so it came to pass that the
former opponent of the President was selected in the place
of one who was his earnest advocate from the beginning.
Though not backward in his claim for an elective office, he
was still little inclined to play the servile part in an appointive
position. He was willing enough to submit to the
democratic judgment of his fellow men when he was given a
public opportunity to present his claim, but he timidly shrank
from a personal solicitation of a Presidential favor.</p>

<p>His final letter on the history of this affair is rather
tinged with another sorrow. Mr. Edwards being offended
with him, he wrote that the better part of one's life consisted
of his friendships; that at a word he could have had
the office any time before the Department was committed
to Mr. Butterfield; and that word he forbore to speak
chiefly for Mr. Edwards' sake,&mdash;losing the office that he
might gain it, and that to lose his <i>friendship</i>, by the effort
for him would oppress him very much, were he not sustained
by the utmost consciousness of rectitude.<a name="FNanchor_263_270" id="FNanchor_263_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_270" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>The selection of Butterfield for the General Land Office
did not shake the efforts of the friends of Lincoln to secure
recognition of his valiant services in the Whig ranks. He
was tendered the governorship of Oregon by Fillmore. The
new land held forth enticing political promises, it was soon
to become a state and a senatorship was a fair prospect.
Close associates advised acceptance. Lamon says that Lincoln
saw it all, and would have accepted "if his wife consented,"
but she refused to do so; and that time has shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that she was right.<a name="FNanchor_264_271" id="FNanchor_264_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_271" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> What part Lincoln would have
played in history if he had become a senator from Oregon
may be interesting but none the less vain speculation.
If the Lincoln and Douglas debates had been shifted
from the prairies of Illinois to the national arena at Washington,
who can say that Lincoln and Douglas might not
have become rivals for the Presidency? It has been quite
the fashion to assume that the Senate would have been destructive
to the future of Lincoln, overlooking the plain
fact that the National Assembly was the home of the renown
of Douglas and his ladder to the Presidential nomination.
Lincoln was not spoiled by the highest office in the
land and there is no surety that the senate would have
proved the grave of his career.</p>

<p>Two scant years of Congressional life worked a change in
the politician from Illinois. He had come in a subdued mood
to mingle in national affairs. Shrinkingly, he measured his
humble equipment with that of illustrious legislators in
Washington. While he left a respectable, but not an eminent
record of achievement, he departed with a store of confidence
in his worth. His intimate association with northern
and southern leaders, his sure, inner knowledge of national
legislative methods, his insight into the uncompromising character
of the slavery controversy were not wasted in the part
he was soon to play in events that would shake the very
foundation of the nation.</p>

<p>Still, he returned to Springfield unhonored. In the opinion
of his constituency, he made a series of blunders. His
attitude on the war lost the district to the Whig party. His
"Spot Resolutions" had become a by-word in the community,
they were liberally satired in song and story. The political
career of Lincoln had seemingly come to an inglorious conclusion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE SCHOOL OF SOLITUDE</h3>


<p>Upon his return from Washington, Abraham Lincoln
attended to a growing legal practice. He apparently
lost his interest in communal matters, having tasted the
allurements and bitterness of public service. He had largely
outgrown the passion for ordinary official distinction. He
was ready to go back to the circuit with its hardships and
rudeness. To win renown as a lawyer now seemed his sole
ambition.</p>

<p>Still as the compromise measures of 1850 ended another
national crisis, he readily renewed his interest in the march
of events. A loyal Whig, still, he acceded to the Clay and
Webster solution of the perturbed political conditions with
some misgiving. He poorly tolerated the burdens added to
the yoke of the fugitive slave&mdash;the premium placed upon
bondage rather than freedom. During this stormy period
of general controversy, in his lonely way he settled the main
issue. A story told by a close friend is significant of the
seriousness of the struggle. As they were coming down a
hill, Herndon said to Lincoln that the time was coming when
they should all have to be either Abolitionists or Democrats.
Lincoln thought a moment and then answered ruefully that
when that time came his mind would be made up, for he believed
the slavery question could never be successfully compromised.<a name="FNanchor_265_272" id="FNanchor_265_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_272" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p>Though zealous for action, for a time, he was in the gloom
of despair. Most men were lost in their own affairs. The
furtive Abolitionist raised his voice as in a wilderness. The
busy world took mean note of the cry of anguished slave.
About this time Herndon states that Lincoln was speculating
with him about the deadness of things, and deeply regretted
that his human strength was limited by his nature to rouse
the world, and despairingly exclaimed that it was hard to
die and to leave one's country no better than if one had
never lived for it.<a name="FNanchor_266_273" id="FNanchor_266_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_273" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Here is again communion with the soul
whose thoughts were of the despised and the lowly. To
Lamon and other men who cannot rise to kinship with him
in such an hour, he must forever remain a mystery. It is
for this reason that some who were near him seldom comprehended
the extensiveness of his sympathy, seldom knew
the divinity of his hopes, and his surpassing love of kind.</p>

<p>Lincoln was a stumbling student in the domain of eulogy.
His mind scorned fanciful statement. He was no hero worshipper.
Washington, alone, remained the shrine of his
homage. He mastered indiscriminate devotion to person in
his loyalty to principle. For this reason, to many, he seemed
impassive and self centered. It is strange that the man so
little prone to adulation should, himself, be the recipient of
almost universal adoration. So his address in 1852 on the
death of Clay shows little of the devotional element. Even
in the shadow of the grave of the great Compromiser, there
is no chant of an admiring friend&mdash;no speech leaping from
the heart. Lincoln himself felt its limitations.<a name="FNanchor_267_274" id="FNanchor_267_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_274" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> In this
address, he called attention to the striking fact that Clay
never spoke merely to be heard, that his eloquence was
always directed to practical action.</p>

<p>It is only when Lincoln approached the discussion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
slavery question that he ceased commonplace commendation.
He gave much time to that issue. That he brooded over the
solemn statement of the patriots of the Republic is shown
in his use of the far-famed utterance of Jefferson: "I had
for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any
attention to public affairs, confident that they were in good
hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to the
shore from which I am not distant. But this momentous
question, like a fire-bell in the night, awakened and filled me
with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union.
It is hushed, indeed, for a moment. But this is a reprieve
only, not a final sentence. A geographical line coinciding
with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived
and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated,
and every irritation will mark it deeper and
deeper."<a name="FNanchor_268_275" id="FNanchor_268_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_275" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>He likewise dwelt on the exulting protest of Clay against
the enemies of liberty and ultimate emancipation, who would
go back to the era of our liberty and independence and
muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return,
who would blow out the moral light and penetrate the human
soul, and eradicate the light of reason and the love of
liberty.<a name="FNanchor_269_276" id="FNanchor_269_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_276" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>We learn something of the trend of his thoughts in his
discussion of the colonization proposal of Clay that there
was a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her
children, whose ancestors had been torn from her by the
ruthless hand of fraud and violence, who, transplanted in a
foreign land, would carry back to their native soil the
rich fruits of religion, civilization, law and liberty. Lincoln
passes this benediction on the plan: "May it indeed be realized.
Pharaoh's country was cursed with plagues, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
hosts were lost in the Red Sea, for striving to retain a captive
people who had already served them more than four
hundred years. May like disasters never befall us! If, as
the friends of colonization hope, the present and coming generations
of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in
freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery, and
at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long-lost
fatherland with bright prospects for the future, and this
too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have
suffered by the change, it will indeed be a glorious consummation."<a name="FNanchor_270_277" id="FNanchor_270_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_277" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was seeking no temporary expedient. He saw
that abolitionism was only a step in the problem, that beyond
freedom was the greater question that still terrifies the Union.
Statesmanlike, he was not willing merely to trifle with the
casual remedy. Like Clay, he would have put an end to the
baffling issue by an operation titanic in contemplation and
astounding in sweep. So this eulogy on Clay is largely a
discussion of a looming problem of his time, a safe sign that
he was awake to the gathering storm.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1852 was colorless. Both parties were
arrayed on the side maintaining the sacredness of the Compromise
Measures. All slavery agitation was severely deprecated.
While the South feared and shunned the triumph of
the Whig party, there was still scant surface appearance of
a sectional contest. There was little in the issues involved
to awaken moral vitality. Lincoln took no glowing part in
the electoral contest. Lamon declares that his speeches during
the campaign were coarse, strained in humor, petulant,
unworthy of the orator, and pervasive with jealousy at the
success of his rival&mdash;Douglas.<a name="FNanchor_271_278" id="FNanchor_271_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_278" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Though Lincoln was sure from the first, of the sin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
slavery, still, even at this period, he continued in conduct
with slow paced movement as if half afraid of being ahead
of the sweep of events. Herndon aided in helping him keep
abreast with advanced abolition literature, and sought to
win him to a championship of the radical school. Like
Washington, he marked out his own path. Neither friend
nor foe could swerve him, hasten or check his advance.
Broad-minded, open to appeal, no man was less influenceable
in final judgment. Herndon's weighty statement confirms
this distinctiveness of Lincoln's individuality. "I was never
conscious of having made this impression on Mr. Lincoln,
nor do I believe I ever changed his views. I will go further
and say, that, from the profound nature of his conclusions
and the labored method by which he arrived at them, no
man is entitled to the credit of having either changed or
greatly modified them."<a name="FNanchor_272_279" id="FNanchor_272_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_279" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>At first, he began in his office in plain speech to comment
upon the virulent contest between freedom and slavery, contending
that delay was intensifying the ultimate clash, that
like two wild beasts in sight of each other, but chained and
held apart, the deadly antagonists would some day break
their bonds, and then the question would be settled.<a name="FNanchor_273_280" id="FNanchor_273_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_280" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>He spoke bitterly of the attitude of the judiciary, the
men who should have been in the very front of the fight;
who seemed more zealous of the right of property than that
of personal liberty. He said that it was singular that the
Courts would hold that a man never lost his right to his
property that has been stolen from him, but that he instantly
lost his right to himself if he was stolen.<a name="FNanchor_274_281" id="FNanchor_274_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_281" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Thus his mind
moved faster than public sentiment, and thus he became
prepared for decisive action before the culminating Kansas
and Nebraska affair threw the North into commotion. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
seemed the barometer of the national conscience, and though
his slow progress appeared painful to the radical yet it was
genuine and far more remorseless than immature reform.
When the conservative mind of Lincoln was stirred to action,
it was a definite sign of progress. He saw that the steady
march of slavery was slowly perverting the very principles
of democracy, that it was a challenge to the integrity of the
republic, that sooner or later it would subvert the government
or be subverted by the government.</p>

<p>He noted that there were about six hundred thousand
men non-slaveholding whites in Kentucky to about thirty-three
thousand slave holders; that when a convention recently
assembled, there was not a single representative of the non-slaveholding
class. He told a friend that the thing was
spreading like wildfire over the country and that in a few
years Illinois would be ready to accept the institution.
When asked to what he attributed the change that was going
on in public opinion, he said that he had put that question
to a Kentuckian shortly before, who answered by saying
that one might have any amount of land, money or bank-stock,
and while travelling around, nobody would be wiser;
but, if one had a darky trudging at his heels, everybody
would see him, and know that he owned a slave; that if a
young man went courting, the only inquiry was, how many
negroes he or she owned. He added, that the love for slave
property was swallowing up every other mercenary possession;
that its ownership betokened, not only the possession
of wealth, but indicated the gentleman of leisure, who was
above and scorned labor.<a name="FNanchor_275_282" id="FNanchor_275_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_282" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>It has been a historical fashion to brand Douglas as the
author of all the ills that came in the course of the Kansas-Nebraska
agitation. He has suffered more than any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
northern leader for participation therein. He did not inaugurate;
he reluctantly adopted radical action to maintain
his leadership in the Democratic party. The abolitionists
were growing more resolute and exacting in their demands,
startling the northern conscience. No compromise
could still their protests; they would not tolerate constitutional
obligations that stood in the way of immediate emancipation.
At the South, the slave dynasty was daily growing
more restless under the real or assumed danger from northern
agitation. New enactments were deemed indispensable, as if
legislation could stay the rising tide of sentiment against
the return of fugitive slaves. The South was, under the educational
tutelage of Calhoun, prepared to demand the right
to carry slaves throughout every inch of the national territory
without restraint from Congress.</p>

<p>Compromise could delay but not settle such a contest.
When moral instincts were aroused on one side and fear on
the other, the inevitable clash could not be permanently
avoided. Dixon of Kentucky, through his far-reaching statement
upon the question of slavery he knew no "Whiggery"
and no Democracy,<a name="FNanchor_276_283" id="FNanchor_276_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_283" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> decisively noted the new era in American
politics, and showed the desperate chasm that daily grew
more divisive, not to be covered over until the blood of a
million men was offered up as a sacrifice to the most momentous
martyrdom in history. Atchison of Missouri, who
declared he would sacrifice everything but his hope of heaven
for slavery,<a name="FNanchor_277_284" id="FNanchor_277_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_284" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> was anxious for the place of Douglas that he
might champion the legislation that would secure the repeal
of the Missouri Compromise. To gain this position, he would
relinquish his distinction as Acting President pro tem of
the Senate.</p>

<p>For twenty years, Douglas had fought in the party ranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
until he stood fair to become its leader. He had either to
become champion of the new policy, or as he saw it, to sacrifice
the work of a lifetime. In the party councils he contested
the wisdom of the policy and eloquently portrayed its
far-reaching consequences. He loved his country but not all
of his kind. Patriot but not humanitarian, he would not
peer behind the curtain of a clashing North and South. The
nature of the bitter conflict through which Douglas passed
before he submitted to the southern policy, appears from
his counsel to a young student and friend never to go into
politics; that if he did, no matter how clear it might be to him
that the present was an inheritance from the past, no matter
how conscientiously he might feel that his hands were
tied, with loyalty to ancient institutions rather than what
he might prefer to do if free to choose, still he would be
vilified, traduced, and finally sacrificed to some local interest
or unreasoning passion like Adams, Webster and Clay. He
continued that he was surprised that the proposal to repeal
came from the South and dreaded the effect, and said so;
still for nearly twenty years he had fought for a place
among the leaders of the party which seemed to him most
likely to promote the prosperity of his country, and had
won it.... If he retained his leadership, he argued that
he might help to guide the party aright in some graver crisis,
and if he threw it away, he not only destroyed himself, but
he became powerless for good forever after.</p>

<p>He then impetuously contended that an individual ought
not to oppose his judgment to that of a great party, and
besides though surprised at its source, he believed that the
repeal would work to the advancement of freedom rather
than otherwise, as his vilifiers charged. He finally pleaded
that he was politically right in keeping within the pale of
the Constitution; and right as to the moral effect, and right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
as a party leader anxious to help in keeping his party true
to the whole country.<a name="FNanchor_278_285" id="FNanchor_278_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_285" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Thus Douglas made his way to the
sons of the South and became the father of the Nebraska
controversy and of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.</p>

<p>Douglas had not trained himself in the school of political
defeat and hesitated to forego his prestige of leadership.
To gain the South, he risked his hold on the North. Had he
had the courage to dare, the wisdom to know, the moral heroism
to do, he might have become the foremost personality
in American politics, honoring instead of shadowing the history
of his time. In a solemn moment he took counsel of his
fears rather than his integrity, and doubted the triumph of
the one cause that has revolutionized history. With all his
political sagacity, he lacked the supreme instinct that transcends
the shrewdness of the day and links itself to the final
triumphing movement.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer of 1854 when the whole
North quivered with the hurrying march of events following
the Nebraska agitation, and thundered its protests into
Washington, Lincoln grew to the demands of the hour with
his wonted sureness. He turned over and over the whole
issue. He did not halt at the injustice of the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise, but went beyond its consideration to
the problems of the age, of which that act was only a grave
symptom.</p>

<p>Now and then in small meetings, he spoke out of the fullness
of his feelings. His friends scanned a strange change.
Coming to listen to his quaint stories, they returned, exalted
by hearing a speaker who raised the controversy above the
shifting events of the hour to the broad tableland where
right and wrong meet on the field of battle. They beheld a
man who lifted the discussion into the pure realms of eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
justice, above all questions of policy, into the arena of the
higher humanity. Prejudices of a lifetime trembled in the
balance. Men were baptised with a new political faith.
They instinctively turned to the master and yielded, to the
power of a personality speaking in the name of immortal
righteousness. He was no longer in his former haunts, the
tavern or the grocery. He was seen "mousing" around
libraries. He was communing with the Fathers of the Republic,
seeking wisdom from them.</p>

<p>These five years following his Congressional experience
are noteworthy in his life, though scantily known. Now
and then a chance remark, the eulogy on Clay, a letter to a
friend, reveal a strong man struggling with a giant problem.
During all this time, he was thinking out the portentous
question that was agitating a tempest. The greatest contests
of the world are not fought on the battlefield, in the
presence of vast armies, when the drum beats or the bugle
calls to action. The sublimest battles in history are waged
in the lonely soul. There, the destiny of nations is determined
before its formal expression in legislative discussion,
judicial decision or national controversy.</p>

<p>The grasping disposition of slavery convinced Lincoln
that the encounter was inevitable. Before the formation of
the Republican party, he sanctioned the statement that the
time was approaching when it would be necessary to take a
determined stand either for or against slavery. During this
period, he waited and bided his time; all these years he saw
with joy, clouded with occasional despair, the day approaching
when another blow could be struck for freedom, for the
principles of the fathers and for the spreading of democratic
influence. These were splendid years of preparation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>AN EMANCIPATED POLITICIAN</h3>


<p>The indignation that rushed through Illinois when the
first news from the Capitol forecast the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise had not yet abated, when Douglas
dauntlessly sought to explain his course of conduct in Chicago.
He was howled down and denied liberty of speech.
This naturally brought on a reaction. The contention that
the distinguished senator had been struck before being heard,
added martyrdom to his bold conduct.</p>

<p>As he wandered down the State closer to the home of
ardent democracy, he was met with growing enthusiasm. His
ingenious sophistry turned popular sovereignty into a seeming
contest for a principle and Illinois was being carried
away by his triumphant oratory and logic. There is little
wonder that the man who breasted the storm of debate in
the Senate should make headway in the land of his friends
where office holders and supporters gloried in his fame and
were elated when he chanted forth his alluring doctrine as a
solution to political conditions.</p>

<p>His main effort was made at the State Fair in October,
1854, an occasion that called together the intelligence of
Illinois in days when few occasions permitted the satisfaction
of social life. Enhancing its importance, this political
gathering was to mark the opening of the campaign to determine
the selection of a Senator. The speech of Douglas was
to be almost a national event. Upon him the hopes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
State democracy centered in the conditions following the late
political tempest. Douglas was equal to the occasion and
his friends rejoiced.</p>

<p>Lincoln had made such a profound impression at the time
among the Whig orators, that he was chosen to bear the
brunt of the reply to the "State Fair Speech" of the wily
leader of the Democratic party. Lincoln surpassed every
expectation. Neither side was prepared for the terrible onslaught.
A new and dauntless advocate appeared giving
power to the gathering protesting elements against the aggressive
championship of Douglas. Herndon, himself, was
thoroughly amazed, and tells us that the speaker quivered
with emotion, that he felt upon his soul the truths burn
which he uttered, that crushing with his logic the Nebraska
bill he rent it into shreds and held it up to the scorn and the
mockery of the crowds, that he took the heart captive
and broke like a sun over the understanding.<a name="FNanchor_279_286" id="FNanchor_279_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_286" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In his
reply Douglas was excited, and his voice loud and shrill.
Lamon relates that shaking his forefinger at the democratic
malcontents, and declaiming rather than debating, he occupied
to little purpose the brief interval remaining until the
adjournment for supper; that then, promising to resume his
address in the evening, he went his way, and evening came
but not the orator.<a name="FNanchor_280_287" id="FNanchor_280_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_287" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>While Lincoln was moving in the moral realm, still, at
this very time, note must be taken of the politician in the
valley. The enthusiasm that followed his baptismal oration
had not calmed when Lovejoy announced a gathering that
evening of the friends of freedom. The Nebraska movement
fed the Abolitionists with abounding faith in a speedy
triumph. With a rising sense of their strength, fairly
"snuffing" the coming victory they looked for, Lovejoy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
his associates hastened to command Lincoln's attendance at
their meeting. Herndon vividly describes the occasion, saying
that their plan was to induce Lincoln to speak for them,
yet he doubted the propriety of Lincoln's taking any stand
yet. Lincoln was ambitious to climb to the United States
Senate, and on grounds of policy it would not do for him
to occupy at that time such advance ground as they were
taking. On the other hand, it was equally dangerous to
refuse a speech for the Abolitionists. Herndon then hunted
up Lincoln and urged him to avoid meeting the enthusiastic
champion of Abolitionism. "Go home at once," he said.
"Take Bob with you and drive somewhere into the country
and stay till this thing is over." Lincoln under the pretense
of having business in Tazewell County drove out of
town in his buggy, and did not return until the apostles of
Abolitionism had gone to their homes. Herndon believes
that this arrangement saved Lincoln, for if he had endorsed
the resolutions passed at the meeting, or spoken simply in
favor of freedom that night, he would have been identified
with all the rancor and extremes of Abolitionism, and if,
on the contrary, he refused to take a position as advanced
as theirs, he would have lost their support.<a name="FNanchor_281_288" id="FNanchor_281_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_288" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Another incident told by the same writer makes it necessary
ever to keep track of Lincoln, the wary politician:
"One day I read in the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> an article endorsing
slavery, and arguing that from principle the enslavement
of either whites or blacks was justifiable and right. I
showed it to Lincoln, who remarked that it was 'rather rank
doctrine for northern Democrats to endorse. I should like
to see,' he said, with emphasis 'some of these Illinois newspapers
champion that.' I told him if he would only wait and
keep his own counsel I would have a pro-slavery organ in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Springfield publish that very article. He doubted it, but
when I told him how it was to be done, he laughed and said,
'Go in.' I cut the slip out and succeeded in getting it in
the paper named. Of course it was a trick but it acted
admirably. Its appearance in the new organ, although without
comment, almost ruined that valuable journal, and my
good natured friend the editor was nearly overcome by the
denunciation of those who were responsible for the organ's
existence. My connection and Lincoln's too,&mdash;for he endorsed
the trick,&mdash;with the publication of the condemned
article was eventually discovered, and we were thereafter
effectually prevented from getting another line in the paper.
The anti-slavery people quoted the article as having been
endorsed by a democratic newspaper in Springfield and Lincoln
himself used it with telling effect. He joined in the
popular denunciation, expressing great astonishment that
such a sentiment could find lodgment in any paper in Illinois,
although he knew full well how the whole thing had been
carried through."<a name="FNanchor_282_289" id="FNanchor_282_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_289" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln was alive to the best methods of persuasion. He
knew that men were the children of emotion and that while
many would be calloused to the slavery of the black man,
nothing would arouse the North quicker than this doctrine
of the bondage of the white man. While slavery was making
every effort to fasten its fangs on the nation, Lincoln was
not averse to take advantage of a shrewd move to strike
heavy blows at the potent institution.</p>

<p>He entered deeply into the contest. Lincoln knew that
it involved the painful rending of party allegiance. His
letter to Palmer sheds light on the intensity of the struggle,
the heroism of the democratic minority whose loyalty to
country and righteousness surpassed a deep-seated partisanship:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
"You are," he said, "and always have been, honestly
and sincerely a Democrat; and I know how painful it must
be to an honest sincere man to be urged by his party to the
support of a measure, which in his conscience he believes to be
wrong. You have had a severe struggle with yourself, and
you have determined not to swallow the wrong. Is it just
to yourself that you should, in a few public speeches, state
your reasons, and thus justify yourself? I wish you could;
and yet I say, 'Don't do it if you think it will injure you.'"<a name="FNanchor_283_290" id="FNanchor_283_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_290" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln recognized that political progress is not alone the
result of intellectual supremacy; that it is a painful struggle;
that policy must be mingled with principle; that the world
does not welcome the unadulterated gospel; that through the
centuries, humanity has groped its way to the far light
with eyes blinded by the superstition of ages and selfishness.</p>

<p>The moral prophet is seldom the political leader of his
time. He stands above his age. The politician is part of it.
One sees things as they should be, the other as they are.
One is splendidly indifferent to results, the other keenly appreciative
of them. Lincoln made no false step. Had he
walked too fast for his day he might have been the Garrison
of the West, but not the party guide. With sure instinct
he felt that the time was not ripe for companionship with
the Abolitionists. Illinois was not ready. If he was to continue
his hold on public sentiment, to guide it, he could not
flash the truth before the gaze of humanity. Despite the
suffering of martyrs, the heroism of statesmen, the sacrifices
of seekers of the truth, wrong was still "upon the throne,"
and "truth upon the scaffold," the world was not slow in
crucifying its heroes of speech and deed. Lincoln recognized
the weaknesses of men, the shortcomings of human
nature, the superstition of centuries. He was content with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
slow progress, uncowed by disappointment, and realized that
the grumbling world emancipated its heart and mind slowly.</p>

<p>Under the spell of the State Fair speech, Whig leaders
earnestly besought Lincoln to follow Douglas up until election.<a name="FNanchor_284_291" id="FNanchor_284_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_291" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
So again at Peoria, Lincoln broke forth in impassioned
utterances that took captive the judgment. His logic
throbbed with passion for freedom, for liberty and emancipation.
He lifted his hearers above the jangling of everyday
life, above the mists of hate, of jealousy, of selfishness, into
a region of the brotherhood of man. Unlike his speech at
Springfield, this was written out. It demonstrates that his
supremacy among the eminent leaders of Illinois was not a
matter of the choice of the hour.</p>

<p>With marvelous power of directness, he plotted out the
line of discussion. He made much of the fact that the
Fathers of the Republic regarded slavery as an evil worthy
of restriction and looked forward to the day of its ultimate
abolition, saying that as the subject was no other than part
of the larger question of domestic slavery, he wished to make
the distinction between the existing institution and the extension
of it so clear that no honest man could misunderstand
him, and no dishonest man could successfully misrepresent
him.<a name="FNanchor_285_292" id="FNanchor_285_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_292" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>With telling effect he quoted the words of Douglas himself
as to the sincere observance of the Missouri Compromise that
put a barrier in the way of the progress of slavery: "It
had its origin," said Douglas, "in the hearts of all patriotic
men, who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of
our glorious Union&mdash;an origin akin to that of the Constitution
of the United States, conceived in the same spirit of
fraternal affection, and calculated to remove forever the
only danger which seemed to threaten, at some distant day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to sever the social bond of Union. All the evidences of public
opinion of that day seemed to indicate that this Compromise
had been canonized in the hearts of the American
people, as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever
be reckless enough to disturb."<a name="FNanchor_286_293" id="FNanchor_286_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_293" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> His comment on this unanswerable
statement of Douglas is significant of the nature
of Lincoln's peculiar fairness and consequent strength. Lincoln
said that he did not read the extract to involve Judge
Douglas in an inconsistency, for if he afterward thought he
was wrong, it was right for him to change, but he brought
it forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the
Missouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year
1849.<a name="FNanchor_287_294" id="FNanchor_287_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_294" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>In the North and South passion had unloosed its tongue
and crimination and recrimination were daily becoming
steady servants in debate and discussion on the slavery question.
With it all, Lincoln calmly sat in judgment.</p>

<p>"Before proceeding let me say that I think I have no prejudices
against the Southern people. They are just what we
would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist
between them, they would not introduce it. If it did now
exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I
believe of the masses North and South.... When Southern
people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of
slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is
said that the institution exists, and that it is very difficult
to get rid of it in any satisfactory way, I can understand
and appreciate the same. I surely will not blame them for
not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If all
earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do
as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to
free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
land. But a moment's reflection would convince me that
whatever of high hope (as I think there is) there may be in
this in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible&mdash;what
then? Free them all, and keep them among us as
underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their condition?
I think I would not hold one in slavery at any rate,
yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people
upon. What next? Free them and make them politically
and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of
this, and if mine would, we well know that those of the great
mass of whites will not. Whether this feeling accords with
justice and sound judgment is not the sole question, if indeed
it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill
founded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot make
them equals. It does seem to me that systems of gradual
emancipation might be adopted, but for their tardiness in
this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the
South.</p>

<p>"When they remind us of their constitutional rights, I
acknowledge them&mdash;not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; and
I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their
fugitives which should not in its stringency be more likely
to carry a free man into slavery than our ordinary criminal
laws are to hang an innocent one.</p>

<p>"But all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse
for permitting slavery to go into our free territory than it
would for reviving the African slave-trade by law. The
law which forbids the bringing of slaves from Africa, and
that which has so long forbidden the taking of them into
Nebraska, can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle,
and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible
excuses as that of the latter."<a name="FNanchor_288_295" id="FNanchor_288_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_295" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>In the domain of literature on the slavery question there
is no statement that surpasses this in charity, sanity and
wisdom. With his overflowing hatred to slavery, he still kept
justice as his guide and was slow to blame the South for
the long standing sin. In this he towers above the Abolitionists
who put upon the slave holders the burdens of a
past as well as a present wrong. Yet unlike the politician
he did not lose his ideal and become palsied and apologetic.
He saw the need of keeping alive the principles of the Republic.
Hastening the coming of the better humanity, with
patience for human shortcoming, with zeal for the triumph of
emancipation, he continued in his peculiar, lonely and potent
way the advocacy of justice to God's dusky children.</p>

<p>In the Senate Douglas with triumphant eloquence charged
Seward and Sumner and the North with having repudiated
the Missouri Compromise through the Wilmot Proviso and
the measures of 1850. Anti-slavery leaders in the Senate
were confounded by this sudden charge and grandiloquent
accusation. Lincoln took up the challenge and met the
arrogant claim of Douglas without flinching. His analysis
exposed the glittering sophistry of the man who enraptured
the Northern statesmen in the solemn Senate. He not only
held his ground in the face of the brilliant strategy of his
opponent, but even carried the war into the camp of the foe.</p>

<p>He argued that the contention of Douglas that the North
repudiated the Missouri Compromise was no less absurd than
it would be to argue that because they had so far forborne
to acquire Cuba, they would have thereby, in principle, repudiated
former acquisitions and determined to throw them
out of the Union; that it was no less absurd than it would
be to say that because he may have refused to build an
addition to his house, he thereby decided to destroy the
existing house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>This speech abounds in plain, hard English, travelling
direct to the intellect on a straight line. No labored argument
could be half as sure of a welcome to the human mind
as his graphic exposal of the injustice of the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise: "After an angry and dangerous controversy,
the parties made friends by dividing the bone of
contention. The one party first appropriates its own share,
beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it, and
then seizes the share of the other party. It is as if two
starving men had divided their own loaf; the one had hastily
swallowed his half, and then grabbed the other's half just
as he was putting it to his mouth."<a name="FNanchor_289_296" id="FNanchor_289_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_296" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>In nothing did Douglas show greater genius than in hallowing
his doctrine of popular sovereignty. The leaders in
Congress feared openly to fight his vaunted "sacred right of
self government," they were not sure of their ground. Lincoln
with confidence, born of lonely struggle, rushed on the
angry battlefield to run the gantlet of debate on the conquering
doctrine of popular sovereignty: "When the white
man," he said, "governs himself, that is self-government,
but when he governs himself and also governs another man,
that is more than self government&mdash;that is despotism. If the
negro is a man, why then my ancient faith teaches me that
'all men are created equal,' and that there can be no moral
right in connection with one man's making a slave of another.</p>

<p>"Judge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm,
paraphrases our argument by saying: 'The white people
of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves, but
they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes!'
Well! I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are and will
continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
I do not say the contrary. What I do say is that no man
is good enough to govern another man without that other's
consent."<a name="FNanchor_290_297" id="FNanchor_290_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_297" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> In a single weighty phrase he crushed the elaborate
argument of the Senator of Illinois and left its fair
form so that only a shattered frame remains.</p>

<p>At times he spoke like a seer lifted above the petty prejudices
of the time. He declared that the spirit of mutual concession&mdash;that
first wrought the Constitution, and thrice saved
the Union&mdash;and that trust in a national compromise, would
thus be strangled; that the South flushed with triumph
would provoke and aggress, and the North, brooding on
wrong, would resent and retaliate. He alleged that already a
few in the North defied all constitutional restraint, and even
menaced the institution of slavery in the southern States;
that already a few in the South claimed the constitutional
right to hold slaves in the free States and demanded the revival
of the slave trade. That it was a grave question for
lovers of the Union whether the final destruction of the
Missouri Compromise, and with it the spirit of all compromise,
would not fatally increase the number of both.<a name="FNanchor_291_298" id="FNanchor_291_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_298" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>His sanity enabled him to guide the erring and confounded
in the days of doubt. "Some men," he said, "mostly Whigs,
who condemn the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, nevertheless
hesitate to go for its restoration, lest they be thrown
in company with the Abolitionists. Will they allow me, as
an old Whig, to tell them, good humoredly, that I think
this is very silly? Stand with anybody that stands right.
Stand with him while he is right, and part with him when
he goes wrong. Stand with the Abolitionists in restoring
the Missouri Compromise, and stand against him when he
attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law. In the latter case
you stand with the Southern disunionist. What of that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
You are still right. In both cases you are right. In both
cases you expose the dangerous extremes. In both you stand
on middle ground, and hold the ship level and steady."<a name="FNanchor_292_299" id="FNanchor_292_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_299" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Above all, this speech will live for its moral intensity,
hatred of injustice and hunger for righteousness. Throughout
this long appeal and uniting its links of logic is an overpowering
and pervasive sentiment of the highest humanity.
Now and then an outburst against oppression comes forth
resistlessly, yet in the company of a sober expression, logical
intensity and a broad outlook peculiar to him. These rival
the most impassioned utterances of Phillips and Garrison.
Like O'Connell, he sent his voice "careering like the thunderstorm
against the breeze, to tell the slaveholders of the Carolinas
that God's thunderbolts are hot, and to remind the
bondman that the dawn of his redemption is already breaking."<a name="FNanchor_293_300" id="FNanchor_293_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_300" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>With elation he passed from the sordidness and the turmoil
of the courtroom and daily pettiness of common political
controversy to the championship of an all-mastering principle.
He fed the "parched souls of men with celestial anodyne,"
with visions of a new and nobler era of humanity.
He made the humblest voter a public participant in the high
service of ridding the nation of the shame of slavery. He
was educating American democracy to practice the principles
of the Declaration of Independence, restoring to life seemingly
dead doctrines of the fathers. Better than a course in
ethics was the uplift of his utterances, the call to higher
attitudes.</p>

<p>He declared his hate in ringing words, of the indifference
to, if not covert zeal for, the spread of slavery, of depriving
the Republic of its just influence in the world, of enabling
the enemies of Democracy to engage in the taunt of hypocrisy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of forcing so many men into open war with the fundamental
principles of civil liberty, criticising the Declaration
of Independence and insisting that there was no right principle
but self interest.<a name="FNanchor_294_301" id="FNanchor_294_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_301" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>In measured language befitting his solemn theme, Lincoln
continued his prophetic condemnation of slavery, charging
that, steadily as man's march to the grave, the people were
giving up the old for the new faith; that they had run down
from the declaration that all men were created equal to the
declaration that the enslavement of some was a sacred right
of self government. He dwelt upon the statement of Pettit
that the Declaration of Independence was a "self evident lie"
and said that Pettit did what candor required, and that of
forty-odd Nebraska senators who listened, no one rebuked
him; and asked if that had been said among Marion's men,
Southerners though they were, what would have become of
the man that said it? He added that if it had been said in
old Independence Hall seventy-eight years before, the very
doorkeeper would have throttled the man and thrust him into
the street.<a name="FNanchor_295_302" id="FNanchor_295_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_302" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The day after the Peoria speech, Douglas told Lincoln
that he understood the Territorial question better than all
the opposition in the Senate, and declared that Lincoln had
given him more trouble than his combined antagonists in
Congress. Then Douglas proposed that he would speak no
more during the campaign if Lincoln would do the same,
and to that proposition Lincoln acceded.<a name="FNanchor_296_303" id="FNanchor_296_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_303" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> So though a
speech by Douglas and Lincoln had been advertised for the
following day, Mr. Douglas said that he was too hoarse to
speak, and Lincoln declared that he would not take advantage
of the judge's indisposition, by addressing the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
His friends could not see the affair in the same light, and
they "pressed him for a speech," but Lincoln mysteriously
and unaccountably refused.<a name="FNanchor_297_304" id="FNanchor_297_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_304" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Wisely did shrewd Douglas, the imperial leader in debate,
appeal to the generosity of his opponent to conclude further
controversy. Douglas was an over-match for all of
the radical Abolitionists, the men who spoke of the higher
law, who made war on the charter of American liberties.
His better nature rejoiced in such conflicts. But his genius
was rebuked in the presence of the plain product of the
West, the man who neither relinquished his confidence in the
Constitution nor yet in the ultimate triumph of the freedom
that first gave it its being. Douglas could wage triumphant
war on a Lovejoy and Chase, but the common logic and
simple honesty of Lincoln disconcerted him. The elaborate
oratory of the Senate never confused the Senator of Illinois.
For the first time in his career the national leader was worried
and perplexed. He was neither used to nor prepared for
the combination of talent that could not be diverted from
its way, that met every movement with a baffling complacency.
There was something unanswerable in Lincoln's manner
and mode of discussion. Douglas could fight other men
at a distance, but this opponent made it a hand-to-hand
grapple. At length a man had arisen in the American arena
as skillful in defense of freedom as other men were in that
of slavery. An orator had come who combined the solidity
of Webster, the moral fervor of Phillips, and the
logic of Calhoun; who mingled justice, patriotism and argument
so as to astonish the foremost figure in Washington.
It was no idle sentiment that brought Douglas to tender his
rival the high tribute of a truce.</p>

<p>The Peoria and State Fair speeches created a supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
place for Lincoln in the anti-slavery movement. He was
looked to as likely to gather great strength in the transitional
period of party dissolution. A dominating passion
for place again took hold of him. He declared he prized a
full term in the Senate more than the Presidency. To advance
local political conditions Lincoln was unwisely made a
candidate, in his absence, for the State Legislature that
would soon elect a Senator. Mrs. Lincoln, however, had
Lincoln's name taken off the list of candidates. When Mr.
Lincoln returned, "I went to see him," says Jayne, "in order
to get his consent to run. That was at his house. He was
then the saddest man I ever saw,&mdash;the gloomiest. He walked
up and down the floor, almost crying; and to all my persuasions
to let his name stand in the paper, he said, 'No, I
can't. You don't know all. I say you don't begin to know
one-half, and that's enough!' I did, however, go and have
his name reinstated." After election Lincoln resigned and
by a "still hunt" a Democrat was elected in his stead. The
interference of Mrs. Lincoln, the loss of a vote in the approaching
close contest, according to Jayne, angered the
people of Sangamon County so that for the time being they
hated him.<a name="FNanchor_H_305" id="FNanchor_H_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_305" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln managed his senatorial campaign with adroitness.
Herndon shows that Lincoln did not calmly sit down and
gather his robes around him, waiting for the people to call
him. The vicissitudes of a political campaign brought into
play his management, and developed to its fullest extent his
latent industry. Like other politicians he never overlooked a
newspaper man who had it in his power to say a good or bad
thing of him. Writing to the editor of an obscure little
country newspaper that he had been reading his paper for
three or four years and had paid him nothing for it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
enclosed $10.00 and admonished the editor with complacency
to put it into his pocket and say nothing further about it.
Very soon thereafter Lincoln prepared a political article
and sent it to the rural journalist, requesting its publication
in the editorial columns of his valued paper. The latter,
having followed Lincoln's directions, declined saying that he
long ago made it a rule to publish nothing as editorial matter
not written by himself. Lincoln read the editor's answer
to Herndon, who remarks that although the laugh was on
Lincoln the latter enjoyed the joke heartily, and said that
that editor had a lofty but proper conception of true journalism.<a name="FNanchor_298_306" id="FNanchor_298_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_306" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>His correspondence shows that he was in constant contact
with the ever shifting events of the campaign; that he was
on the lookout for dangerous symptoms; that he was careful
to nicety to measure his strength soberly, and displayed the
same splendid generalship that distinguished him in his Congressional
canvass. The history of his effort to gain a seat
in the Senate may be well trailed in his own letters. A curt
and crisp note advised his friends of his intention. The
following is a sample of many: "You used to express a
good deal of partiality for me, and if you are still so, now is
the time. Some friends here are really for me, for the
U. S. Senate, and I should be very grateful if you could
make a mark for me among your members. Please write
to me at all events giving me the name, postoffices and
'political position' of members around about you."<a name="FNanchor_299_307" id="FNanchor_299_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_307" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Lovejoy had only some twenty-five adherents at the convention
following the "State Fair speech" of Lincoln. Nothing
daunted by the paltry attendance, they adopted a bold
platform. "Ichabod raved," said the Democratic organ in
derision, "and Lovejoy swelled, and all endorsed the sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of that speech." Not content with this, without consent
or consultation, they placed Lincoln's name on the list
of their State Central Committee.<a name="FNanchor_300_308" id="FNanchor_300_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_308" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Lincoln's reply shows
that he was not unwilling to confer with the abolition leaders
and that he deemed it well to keep the way open to an understanding.
"I suppose my opposition to the principle of
slavery is as strong as that of any member of the Republican
party; but I have also supposed that the extent to which I
feel authorized to carry that opposition, practically, was
not at all satisfactory to that party. The leading men who
organized that party were present on the fourth of October
at the discussion between Douglas and myself at Springfield,
and had full opportunity to not misunderstand my position.
Do I misunderstand them? Please write and inform me."<a name="FNanchor_301_309" id="FNanchor_301_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_309" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Like other candidates for public office he was subjected
to all manner of hostility and opposition. He was not spared
the humility of defending his most cherished integrity. Lincoln
was not a common egoist and he sparingly bared his
view. He was little trained in the easy language of self-praise.
Yet once across the bar he displayed rare skill in
the presentation of his position.</p>

<p>"For a senator to be the impartial representative of his
whole State is so plain a duty that I pledge myself to the
observance of it without hesitation, but not without some
mortification that any one should suspect me of an inclination
to the contrary. I was eight years a representative of
Sangamon County in the legislature; and although in a conflict
of interest between that and other counties it perhaps
would have been my duty to stick to old Sangamon, yet it
is not within my recollection that the northern members ever
wanted my vote for any interests of theirs without getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
it."<a name="FNanchor_302_310" id="FNanchor_302_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_310" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Self interest in the campaign did not once lead him astray
in partial judgment of the course of events. Early in January
he informed Washburne that he did not know that it was
of much advantage to have the largest number of votes at
the start; that if he did know it to be an advantage, he
should feel better, for he had more committals than any other
man.<a name="FNanchor_303_311" id="FNanchor_303_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_311" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> He remained a master in the study of the attitude
of the individual voter and delegate. He not only had the
enthusiasm of the orator, but also the keen, calm sense of the
politician, knowing that battles are largely won by strategy
and plan. He did not leave the decision to chance. He
studied the way to reach men, the method of attaching and
calling friends. He was methodical rather than brilliant.</p>

<p>His last letter dealing with the event opens with the statement
that the agony was over at last. He then unfolded
the story of his defeat, how his forty-seven adherents yielded
to the five of Trumbull, how Governor Matteson by a secret
candidacy gathered some anti-Nebraska men to his support;
how five of the latter declared they would never vote for a
Whig and twenty Whigs resentfully contended that they
would not vote for the man of the five. He then stated that
the signal was given to the Nebraska men to turn to Matteson
on the seventh ballot; that soon he only wanted three of an
election; that to detain the bolters Lincoln's friends turned
to Trumbull until he had risen to thirty-five and he, Lincoln,
had been reduced to fifteen; that they would never desert
him except by direction; that he then determined to strike
at once and accordingly advised the fifteen to go for Trumbull
and thus elected him on the tenth ballot.</p>

<p>"Such is the way," said Lincoln, "the thing was done. I
think you would have done the same under the circumstances;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
though Judge Davis, who came down this morning, declares
he never would have consented to the forty-seven being controlled
by the five. I regret my defeat moderately, but I am
not nervous about it. I could have headed off every combination
and been elected, had it not been for Matteson's double
game&mdash;and his defeat now gives me more pleasure than my
own gives me pain. On the whole, it is perhaps as well for
our general cause that Trumbull is elected. The Nebraska
men confess that they hate it worse than anything that could
have happened. It is a great consolation to see them worse
whipped than I am."<a name="FNanchor_304_312" id="FNanchor_304_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_312" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Here a composite Lincoln confronts the student&mdash;a politician
much concerned over defeat and getting pleasure out
of the failure of an unfair opponent. Yet at the same time
another Lincoln reveals himself. Determined to run no risk
in the cause of freedom he yielded cherished hopes and gave
way to an obstinate minority. He would not allow his own
fortune to stand in the way of striking a blow at the slave
power. Lincoln emancipated himself from selfish egoism,
rising in the hour of disappointment to the calmness of
duty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE PILOT OF THE NEW FAITH IN ILLINOIS</h3>


<p>Abolitionism as a gospel showed rather paltry results
for thirty years of unceasing labor. Still its essential
dogma, hatred to human bondage, slowly but steadily
held a larger place in the public thought. Mistakes of the
South and its Northern friends hurried on a crisis. The
Kansas controversy made the issue of a remorseless conflict
clearer by a concrete example of the incompatibility of
freedom and slavery. The nation was thus educated for
aggressive action on the long mooted question. The time
was becoming ripe for the translation of public sentiment
into party platform, statute and decision. The Abolitionist
with relentless gospel even of war on the Constitution was
altogether too radical for the general mind. The slowly
dying Whig party had not kept pace with the advanced
public thought, it was too conservative. The democratic
party kept on its path either of indifference to the slavery
issue or ardent support of the southern view and was the
refuge of those who were dead to the sweep of events. Hence
the necessity of a new party, with a platform that should
sturdily proclaim resistance to the spread of slavery in the
territories; that should register a rising spirit in the North,
growing restless and sensitive as it contemplated the increasing
demands of the Southern institutions, as it grasped
the significance of the issue involving the continued existence
in their primal integrity of cherished principles of the Republic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a grappling for political supremacy of the free labor
of the North and the slave power of the South. Mingled
with the essential spirit of justice pervading Abolitionism
was the growth of the opinion that slavery was a social and
political evil. The public wrath at the repeal of a venerated
Compromise, the increasing discontent at the violent manifestations
of the friends of slavery in Kansas, prepared the
public for the formation of a radical party.</p>

<p>Lincoln being a man of power, was beset by three parties.
He was urged to remain a Whig by the conservatives, to become
a Know-nothing by those drifting on the political
waters. Others sought to baptise him in the spirit of Abolitionism.
Lincoln had long since made his resolution to
array himself on the side of freedom. He was awaiting the
right moment. He saw the time for leadership was coming,
that events were rapidly sweeping forward to a climax. In
the perturbed political condition he was anxious not to go
ahead of events and still not play the laggard. Among all
politicians in American history he was the wisest student of
the public mind.</p>

<p>With true vision, Lincoln foreshadowed the solemn consequences
of the Kansas struggle. He asked if there could
be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence
on the slavery question than the "Nebraska project," and
whether "the first drop of blood so shed would not be the
real knell of the Union."<a name="FNanchor_305_313" id="FNanchor_305_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_313" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Behind the fair form of the Douglas
doctrine of popular sovereignty, he saw the lurking serpent.
He was not deceived by fine, smooth words. In the
beginning, he beheld the gaping wounds of Kansas, the hypocrisy
of the policy professing the name of peace and bringing
in its train the devildom of discord, the curse of a broken,
plighted compact. A letter to his friend Speed in 1855<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
illumines the whole subject, and is a contribution to the political
history of the time&mdash;unsurpassed in statement, in
clearness of understanding, in subdued calmness of judgment:</p>

<p>"You know I dislike slavery, and you fully admit the abstract
wrong of it. So far there is no cause of difference.
But you say that sooner than yield your legal right to the
slave, especially at the bidding of those who are not themselves
interested, you would see the Union dissolved. I am
not aware <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'than'">that</ins>
any one is bidding you yield that right; very
certainly I am not. I leave that matter entirely to yourself.
I also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under
the Constitution in regard to your slaves. I confess I hate
to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and carried
back to their stripes and unrequited toil; but I bite my
lips and keep quiet.... It is not fair for you to assume
that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually
exercises, the power of making me miserable. You ought
rather to appreciate how much the great body of the Northern
people do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their
loyalty to the Constitution and the Union."<a name="FNanchor_306_314" id="FNanchor_306_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_314" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>He then bared with remorseless logic the common southern
attitude: "You say, if you were President, you would send
an army and hang the leaders of the Missouri outrages
among the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes
herself a slave State she must be admitted or the Union must
be dissolved. But how if she votes herself a slave State unfairly,
that is, by the very means for which you say you
would hang men? Must she still be admitted, or the Union
dissolved? That will be the phase of the question when it
first becomes a practicable one."<a name="FNanchor_307_315" id="FNanchor_307_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_315" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>The same letter shows he was aware of the potency of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
partisan lash, was an observer of the methods of securing
results, of the cowardice and timidity of leaders where political
policy appeared on the horizon. He confessed that in
their opposition to the admission of Kansas, they would
probably be beaten; that the Democrats standing as a unit
among themselves, could, directly or indirectly, bribe enough
men to carry the day as they could on the open proposition
to establish a monarchy; that by getting hold of some man
in the North whose position and ability was such that he
could make the support of the measure, whatever it might be,
a party necessity, the thing would be done.<a name="FNanchor_308_316" id="FNanchor_308_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_316" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Then came a biting comment on the pretenses and practices
of those who were spreading the national disease, of
those who had one doctrine in public and another in private,
who worshipped the God of Liberty with speech and Mammon
with their deeds. In the same letter Lincoln said that although
in a private letter or conversation the slaveholders
would express their preference that Kansas should be free,
they would not vote for a man for Congress who would say
the same thing publicly and no such man could be elected
from any district in a slave State; that slave-breeders and
slave-traders were a small, detested class among them; and
yet in politics they dictated the course of the Southerners,
and were as completely their masters as they were the master
of their own negroes.<a name="FNanchor_309_317" id="FNanchor_309_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_317" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>A vivid picture of party uncertainty is seen in his answer
to the inquiry of Speed as to where he then stood. "I think
I am a Whig; but others say there are no Whigs, and say
that I am an Abolitionist. When I was at Washington, I
voted for the Wilmot proviso as good as forty times; and
I never heard of any one attempting to unwhig me for that.
I now do no more than oppose the extension of slavery. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
am not a Know-nothing; that is certain. How could I be?
How could any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be
in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress
in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation
we began by declaring 'that all men are created equal.' We
now practically read it, 'all men are created equal except
negroes.' When the Know-nothings get control, it will read
'all men are created equal, except negroes and foreigners and
Catholics.' When it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating
to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty,&mdash;to
Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken
pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy."<a name="FNanchor_310_318" id="FNanchor_310_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_318" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>To him "Know-nothingism" transcended all questions of
policy, denied the very mission of Democracy, turned back
the hour hand of political progress and was traitor and recreant
to its teachings. He was not sure of his standing in
the transitional period of party dissolution and showed something
in his mental attitude of the spirit of unrest abroad
in the nation and hardly knew whither the trend of events
would carry the American people. Cautious in moving forward
on matters involving method, he was unwedgeable when
the principles of the Republic were at stake. His note of
scorn rings clear and loud to these who, in selfishness and
bigotry, sought exceptions to and a narrow interpretation
of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>By nature Lincoln was a friend of peace. He would have
rejoiced at any plan that produced a peaceful solution of
the vexed problem. No matter how slow the march of freedom,
he would have bridled his wrath. But the aggressiveness
of the South in the Kansas struggle opened his vision
to the fatuity of gradual emancipation. He grew bitter
as Garrison in statement as he contemplated the hypocritic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
limits on freedom, the spread of an institution hostile to
democracy with an ever widening promise of future abatement:
"On the question of liberty as a principle," he wrote
a friend, "we are not what we have been. When we were
the political slaves of King George, and wanted to be free,
we called the maxim that 'all men are created equal,' a self
evident truth, but now when we have grown fat, and have
lost all dread of being slaves ourselves, we have become so
greedy to be masters that we call the same maxim 'a self
evident lie.' The Fourth of July has not quite dwindled
away; it is still a great day&mdash;for burning fire-crackers!!!"<a name="FNanchor_311_319" id="FNanchor_311_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_319" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>The groping of a giant mind concerning itself with a
mammoth problem, the germ of the great speech of Springfield
that was soon to startle the nation with its boldness likewise
shows itself in this same letter. "Our political problem
now is, 'Can we as a nation continue together permanently&mdash;forever&mdash;half
slave and half free?' The problem is too
mighty for me&mdash;may God, in his mercy, superintend the solution."<a name="FNanchor_312_320" id="FNanchor_312_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_320" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Finally the nation changed. The people, once dead to
the cry of the slave, were alive to the evil of slavery. Doctrines
once deemed the outburst of the fanatic were now on
the lips of conservative men, and Lovejoy had become the
consort of the political leader. All these years, Lincoln had
waited in patience for the day when white men should be
ready to fight for the freedom of others. Civilization comes
from a sure, steady and progressive enlightenment of public
sentiment. Genius alone is helpless in the presence of a
palsied national opinion. Consider Lincoln in South Carolina
in 1856, and the hopelessness of the ideal without the
company of circumstances is manifest. Living history comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
from the union of the great man and the happy moment for
the crystallization of advancing public sentiment. In this
sense alone the individual makes history, and it becomes the
record of the few. The great man is the symbol of the
marching life of the multitude and through him humanity
moves resistlessly to its higher attitude.</p>

<p>A gathering of editors opposed to the Nebraska bill on
February 22, 1856, marked the first visible step in the formation
of the Republican party in Illinois. Lincoln was, of
course, not entitled to participate in the public deliberations
of that convention. That he promptly heard the tramp of
coming events is seen in his readiness to play a commanding
part in the early manifestation of the protesting movement.</p>

<p>Declaring that the black cloud of the American party was
threatening to drive the Germans from the ranks of the
party about to be formed, Hon. George Schieder said that
he entered the Decatur convention with a resolution in opposition
to that movement, and helped to form a platform containing
a paragraph against the prescriptive doctrine of the
so-called American party. That portion of the platform
condemning Know-nothingism raised a storm of opposition,
and, in despair, he proposed submitting it to Mr. Lincoln
and abiding by his decision. After carefully reading the
paragraph, Lincoln made the remark that the resolution
introduced by Mr. Schieder was nothing new, that it was
already contained in the Declaration of Independence, and
that they could not form a new party on prescriptive principles.
Mr. Schieder states that this declaration of Lincoln
saved the resolution and helped to establish the new party
on the most liberal basis, and that it was adopted at the
Bloomington Convention, and next at the First National-Republican
Convention at Philadelphia. He further states
that Lincoln crystallized public sentiment, gave it a focal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
point, so that the great majority of the Germans entered
the new party that later made Lincoln President.</p>

<p>Lincoln was in the van of the leaders who rallied to the
support of the infant party that has written such luminous
pages in American history. He showed his wonted sagacity,
when an editor suggested his name as a candidate for Governor,
in immediately advising the nomination of an anti-Nebraskan
Democratic candidate, on the ground that such a
nomination would be more available.<a name="FNanchor_313_321" id="FNanchor_313_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_321" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>To Herndon the caution of Lincoln seemed to partake of
brotherhood with inaction. He hardly realized the sureness
of the unremitting character of his progress. As Lincoln's
partner felt the thrilling approach of a political crisis, he
resolved to unloose Lincoln from his conservative connections
without realizing that the latter was ready to dare the
future on the bark of the coming party. Delegates were to
be elected for the State Convention at Bloomington that
was to breathe life into the Republican party in Illinois.
Herndon signed Mr. Lincoln's name to the call for the Sangamon
County Convention without authority and published
it in a local paper. A dramatic incident ensued:</p>

<p>"John T. Stuart was keeping his eye on Lincoln, with a
view of keeping him on his side&mdash;the totally dead conservative
side. Mr. Stuart saw the published call and grew mad;
rushed into my office, seemed mad, horrified, and said to me,
'Sir, did Mr. Lincoln sign that Abolition call which is published
this morning?' I answered, 'Mr. Lincoln did not sign
that call.'&mdash;'Did Lincoln authorize you to sign it?' said Mr.
Stuart. 'No, he never authorized me to sign it.'&mdash;'Then do
you know that you have ruined Mr. Lincoln?'&mdash;'I did not
know that I had ruined Mr. Lincoln; did not intend to do so;
thought he was a made man by it; that the time had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
when conservatism was a crime and a blunder.'&mdash;'You, then,
take the responsibility of your acts; do you?'&mdash;'I do, most
emphatically.'"</p>

<p>Herndon then wrote Lincoln. He instantly replied that
he adopted what Herndon had done, and promised to meet
Lovejoy and other radicals.<a name="FNanchor_314_322" id="FNanchor_314_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_322" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln did not serve freedom in word only. A free young
negro was in danger of being sold into slavery. The Governor
of Illinois was seen. He responded that he had no right
to interfere. Lincoln rose from his chair, hat in hand, and
exclaimed: "By God, Governor, I'll make the ground in this
country too hot for the foot of a slave, whether you have
the legal power to secure a release of this boy or not."<a name="FNanchor_315_323" id="FNanchor_315_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_323" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>During all the trying time when the liberty of Kansas
was in the balance, when violence was being met with violence,
when even conservative men drifted into the movement to
aid the free state men in opposing the Government, he remained
master of himself, looked beyond the passion of the
moment to the abiding realities. Herndon, who was a participant
in this movement, unfolds a view of the calm, far
sighted man, who knew that violence was the father of great
evils and not a safe foundation for a free state. He says
that Lincoln was informed of their intents, and took the
first opportunity that he could to dissuade them from their
partially formed purpose. They spoke of liberty, justice,
and God's higher law. He answered that he believed "in the
providence of the most men, the largest purse, and the longest
cannon"; that if they were in the minority, they could
not succeed, and that if they were in the majority they could
succeed with the ballot, throwing away the bullet. He
advised them that, "In a democracy where the majority rule
by the ballot through the forms of law, physical rebellions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and bloody resistances" were radically wrong, unconstitutional,
and were treason. He besought them to revolutionize
through the ballot-box, and "restore the Government once
more to the affections and hearts of men, by making it express,
as it was intended to do, the highest spirit of justice
and liberty." Their attempt, he continued, to resist the
laws of Kansas by force, was criminal and all their feeble
attempts would end in bringing sorrow on their heads, and
ruin the cause they would freely die to preserve.<a name="FNanchor_316_324" id="FNanchor_316_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_324" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Well
might Herndon say that this speech saved them from the
greatest follies.<a name="FNanchor_317_325" id="FNanchor_317_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_325" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Instead of desperate measures, money was
forwarded under legitimate conditions, Lincoln joining in
the subscription.</p>

<p>The second step in the formation of the Republican party
was the Convention at Bloomington. Tragic events had
taken place in the State and Nation; signs of the sombre
character of the approaching conflict. Sumner was struck
down in the Senate by the dastard attacks of Brooks, an
act which sent a shudder of anger and indignation through
the North and a wave of approbation through the South.
This incident alone showed the strain that the moorings of
the Nation were undergoing. In Illinois, too, violence asserted
its hideousness, and a delegate, Paul Selby, was
treacherously assaulted by political opponents. The spread
of the Civil War in Kansas heightened the magnitude of the
occasion. The seriousness of the National and State situation
had taken hold of the delegates. The gravity of public
affairs aroused mad instincts. Many were ready for radical
conduct, were ready to meet force with force, and violence
with violence.</p>

<p>From the four corners of the State, dauntless anti-Nebraska
Democrats, conservative Whig, distraught Know-nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
bitter Abolitionist, and those drifting on the tide
of events, gathered under a common impulse in opposition
to the vaunting slave party. Beneath the surface there was
memory of former antagonism. The problem of the hour
was the uniting of these discordant elements into the homogeneity
of common conviction; submerging old and cherished
affiliations with a flood of fealty to a new gospel; the transmuting
raw recruits; quickening the martial spirit commonly
the product only of long service.</p>

<p>It was a time for a momentous speech. Several leaders
of distinction had addressed the convention, when the audience,
with instinctive wisdom, called for Lincoln to
make the closing address. It was one of those rare moments
in human affairs when words may turn the tide of events.
He caught the wandering thoughts of troubled men and gave
them continuity.<a name="FNanchor_318_326" id="FNanchor_318_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_326" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Those long without a political faith were
rejoiced to find a home. Like an inspired giant, he was aglow
with the greatness of his theme. He spoke as the spirit of
the age might have spoken, if it had broken into eloquence
sublime and resistless. Men were brought face to face with
immortal justice, with eternal righteousness. The humblest
hearer lived in the thrill of such communion. Reporters
dropped their pencils and forgot their work; even Herndon,
who was wont to take notes when Lincoln spoke, threw pen
and paper aside, subdued and overcome by the majesty of
his partner's speech.</p>

<p>It was not alone a triumph in immediate results, but also
a triumph in moulding the abiding convictions of men. Above
all the enthusiasm of the moment, there still remained his
solid logic, a logic that made Republicans of life-long Democrats.
John M. Palmer declared that he remembered only
one expression of speech, "We will not dissolve the Union,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and you shall not do it." Others dwelt on his declaration
to meet the occasion with ballots and not bullets, and so the
minds of men as well as the impulses were wisely educated.
The address became famous as "the lost speech." Its renown
grew with age. It became sacred to the memory of
those who heard it and time hallowed its history.<a name="FNanchor_319_327" id="FNanchor_319_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_327" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>In the light of later events, the platform adopted at the
Bloomington Convention seems conservative. It simply rebuked
the administration for its attitude on the Kansas issue,
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and the extension
of slavery into Territories.<a name="FNanchor_320_328" id="FNanchor_320_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_328" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>When the first flood of enthusiasm, after the Bloomington
Convention, subsided, a mysterious apathy, a stifling indifference,
met the new movement, a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'no'">not</ins> unusual phenomenon
in politics or human affairs. Such a time had now come.
It was at this period dark and trying that Lincoln towered
in lonely grandeur. It was easy enough to be brave and
vaunting at a convention when thousands hung on every
word. But now it took a higher heroism to be true to the
cause. Then Lincoln did not flinch. With superb step, with
elated soul, with increasing intrepidity, he continued the
championship of the same principles that took captive the
delegates at Bloomington. He spoke like one in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Lamon tells the story of a ratification meeting five days
after the Bloomington Convention:&mdash;"Mr. Herndon got out
huge posters, announcing the event, and employed a band
of musicians to parade the streets and 'drum up a crowd.'
As the hour of meeting drew near, he 'lit up the Court House
with many blazes,' rung the bells and blew a horn. At
seven o'clock the meeting should have been called to order,
but it turned out to be extremely slim. There was nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
present, with all those brilliant lights, but A. Lincoln, W.
H. Herndon and W. H. Pain. 'When Lincoln came into
the Court-room,' says the bill-poster and horn-blower of this
great demonstration, 'he came with a sadness and a sense of
the ludicrous on his face. He walked to the stand, mounted
it in a kind of mockery,&mdash;mirth and sadness all combined,&mdash;and
said: 'Gentlemen, this meeting is larger than I knew it
would be. I knew that Herndon and myself would come,
but I did not know that any one else would be here; and yet
another has come,&mdash;you, John Pain. These are sad times,
and seem out of joint. All seems dead, dead, dead: but the
age is not yet dead; it liveth as sure as our Maker liveth.
Under all this seeming want of life and motion, the world
does move nevertheless. Be hopeful. Now let us adjourn
and appeal to the people.'"<a name="FNanchor_321_329" id="FNanchor_321_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_329" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>In June the first National Republican Convention met at
Philadelphia. Young, aggressive and flushed with enthusiasm,
it put forth as the standard bearer, John C. Fremont,
the daring, romantic pathfinder. Lincoln received one
hundred and ten votes for the vice-presidency. So little was
this distinction anticipated, that at first he refused to believe
that he was the recipient of the flattering compliment, saying
that it must have been the great Lincoln from Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Like the Bloomington gathering the National Convention
instinctively linked itself in strength to the impressing principles
of the Declaration of Independence. It took a bolder
and more advanced stand than the Illinois Convention, denying
the authority of Congress to give legal existence to
slavery in any Territory and that it was its right and duty to
prohibit therein those "twin relics of barbarism, polygamy
and slavery."<a name="FNanchor_322_330" id="FNanchor_322_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_330" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>In the ensuing campaign, Lincoln, as a presidential elector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and orator towered in the State as strong in his invigorating
championship of the Republican policies. He made
fifty speeches. Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa sent for him.
The impress of his personality was humbly, but pervasively
winning the hearts and minds of men. One man wrote with
sure faith, "Come to our place, because in you do our people
place more confidence than in any other man. Men who do
not read want the story told as you only can tell it. Others
may make fine speeches but it would not be 'Lincoln said so
in his speech.'"<a name="FNanchor_323_331" id="FNanchor_323_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_331" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> A college president spoke of him with
reverence, as, "one providentially raised up for a time like
this, and even should defeat come in the contest, it would be
some consolation to remember we had Hector for a leader."<a name="FNanchor_324_332" id="FNanchor_324_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_332" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>He was most skillful in seeing the danger of Fillmore as a
candidate in withholding strength from Fremont. He studied
the problem as keenly as a legal proposition. No man in all
of the United States saw the issues more plainly or could
state it as precisely. To a Fillmore man he wrote that every
vote withheld from Fremont and given to Fillmore in Illinois
actually lessened Fillmore's chance of being President, for
if Buchanan got all the slave states and Pennsylvania, and
one other State, he would be elected, but if Fillmore got the
slave states of Maryland and Kentucky, then Buchanan
would not be elected and Fillmore would go into the House
of Representatives, and might be made President by a compromise.
Likewise he argued that if Fillmore's friends threw
away a few thousand votes on him in Indiana, it would inevitably
give those states to Buchanan, which would more
than compensate him for the loss of Maryland and Kentucky;
that it was as plain as adding up the weight of three
small hogs for Fillmore who had no possible chance to carry
Illinois for himself, to let Fremont take it, and thus keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
it out of the hands of Buchanan. Lamon remarks that this
letter was discovered by the Buchanan men, printed in their
newspapers, and pronounced, as its author anticipated, "a
mean trick," and that it was a dangerous document to them,
and was calculated to undermine the very citadel of their
strength.<a name="FNanchor_325_333" id="FNanchor_325_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_333" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln's fear of Fillmore was justified by events. While
Fremont was defeated, Bissel the Republican was elected
Governor by a fair margin. To Lincoln, the defeat of Fremont
was prophetic of future triumph. With infinitely
surer vision than President Pierce, he perceived the trend of
events. Beyond seeming setback, he beheld the triumphing
movement. He likened the President to a rejected lover
making merry at the wedding of his rival, in felicitating himself
hugely over the late presidential election, in considering
the result a signal triumph of good men, and a very
pointed rebuke of bad ones. To the statement of Pierce that
the people did it, Lincoln called attention to the fact that
those who voted for Buchanan, were in a minority of the
whole people by about four hundred thousand votes, and
thus the "rebuke" might not be quite as durable as he seemed
to think and that the majority might not choose to remain
permanently rebuked by that minority.<a name="FNanchor_326_334" id="FNanchor_326_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_334" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Strong in the belief that slavery was at war with the essential
spirit of the Republic, he declared that the government
rested on public opinion; that public opinion, on any subject,
always had a "central idea," and that "central idea" in
American political public opinion was until recently "the
equality of man," and although it submitted patiently to
some inequality as a matter of actual necessity, its constant
working was a steady progress toward the practical equality
of all men and the late Presidential election was a struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
by one party to discard that central idea and to substitute
as a central idea the perpetuity of human slavery and its
extension to all countries and colors.<a name="FNanchor_327_335" id="FNanchor_327_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_335" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>This conviction vivified him with new hopes. The leader
called to those in the valley of doubt and indifference to
leave their low-vaulted chamber: "Then let bygones be bygones;
let past differences as nothing be; and with steady
eye on the real issue, let us reinaugurate the good old 'central
idea' of the republic. We can do it. The human heart is
with us; God is with us. We shall again be able not to declare
that 'all States as States are equal,' nor yet that 'all
citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better
declaration, including both these and much more, that 'all
men are created equal.'"<a name="FNanchor_328_336" id="FNanchor_328_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_336" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>LINCOLN AND THE DRED SCOTT DECISION</h3>


<p>With unfailing vision Lincoln was attracted to the
larger issues under all professed and alleged reasons,
both North and South, as to the cause of difference in attitude
on the slavery question. He believed it was largely an
industrial and economical problem, a moral conflict in the
North mainly through the absence of a controlling material
interest. With plain, blunt speech, he laid bare the national
cancer in October, 1856, showing that there was no difference
in the mental or moral structure of the people North and
South, but that in the slavery question the people of the
South had an immediate, immense, pecuniary interest, while
with the people of the North it was merely an abstract question
of moral right.</p>

<p>The slaves of the South, he continued, were worth a thousand
millions of dollars, and that financial interest united
the Southern people as one man; that moral principle was a
looser bond than pecuniary interest. Hence if a Southern
man aspired to be President, they choked him down, that
the glittering prize of the presidency might be held up on
southern terms to Northern ambition. And their conventions
in 1848, 1852 and 1856 had been struggles exclusively among
Northern men, each vying to outbid the other, the South
standing calmly by finally to cry "Going, going, gone" to the
highest bidder.<a name="FNanchor_329_337" id="FNanchor_329_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_337" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>The Dred Scott decision throws a shadow over the judicial
history of the United States. That in an hour of crisis the
supreme judicial tribunal should ally itself with the potent
institution of injustice rather than with humanity, should
interpret the principles of the Constitution and the Declaration
of Independence in a paltry and impoverished manner,
should cringe before title and power and grovel in gloom in
the dawn of a new era of American citizenship, an era that
was to hurl its thunderbolts with ever increasing daring
against the further advance of the slave sovereignty, is
baffling and astounding.</p>

<p>Lincoln realized that the Supreme Court to be venerated,
must be in the van, and not a laggard in the world spirit and
progress; a guide and not a pupil in the best kind of citizenship
and sensitive to the rising tide of public conscience.
The Dred Scott decision did more than any malice of foe to
weaken the general regard for the august tribunal&mdash;the one
supreme discovery of American politics.</p>

<p>It is of interest to study Lincoln's attitude to this decision
and to the tribunal responsible for it. Above most
men, he had preached the gospel of sacred devotion to law
and to the iniquity of mob rule. He was an enemy of all
violence. Yet he rebelliously abided the adjudication that
made the prospective emancipation of the black man more
uncertain, that imprisoned the enlightened principles of the
Fathers of the Republic, that manacled America in her Titan
march on the highway of humanity.</p>

<p>Lincoln maintained in 1857 that judicial decisions had
two uses, to absolutely determine the case decided, and to
indicate to the public how other similar cases would be decided.
Lincoln then argued that if the decision had been
made by the unanimous concurrence of the judges, without
partisan bias, in accordance with legal public expectation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and in no part based on assumed historical facts which were
not really true; or if it had been before the court more than
once, and had there been reaffirmed through a course of
years, it then might be even revolutionary not to acquiesce in
it as a precedent.<a name="FNanchor_330_338" id="FNanchor_330_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_338" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>Still, by the side of the impassioned outbreaks of the abolitionists
and radicals this criticism seems cold and measured.
But Lincoln with his usual apprehension justified his opposition
by democratic example. He confounded Douglas by
recalling the action of his ideal Jackson on a Whig measure,
the National Bank, with the statement that the same Supreme
Court once decided a national bank to be constitutional;
but President Jackson disregarded the decision, and vetoed
a bill for the recharter, partly on constitutional ground declaring
that each public functionary must support the Constitution
as he understood it. And then to the further discomfiture
of Douglas he declared that again and again he
had heard Judge Douglas denounce that bank decision and
applaud General Jackson for disregarding it; that it would
be interesting for him to look over his recent speech, and
see how exactly his fierce philippics against resisting Supreme
Court decisions fell upon his own head.<a name="FNanchor_331_339" id="FNanchor_331_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_339" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Still Douglas
might have retorted that in those days the Whigs were violent
in their denunciation of General Jackson for that very
opposition.</p>

<p>In the same speech Lincoln burst into indignant eloquence
at the policy that was a departure from the old ideas of justice
and liberty and the still more radiant hope of the future
indulged in by Washington, Jefferson and Franklin, that
in time slavery would no longer darken or endanger the
national life, for Lincoln said that in those days the Declaration
was held sacred by all, and thought to include all; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that at this time it was construed, hawked at and torn, till,
if its framers could rise from their graves, they could not
at all recognize it. He observed that all the powers of earth
seemed rapidly combining against the negro; that Mammon,
ambition, philosophy and theology of the day were fast joining
the cry; that they had him in his prison-house, bolted
in with a lock of a hundred keys, which could never be unlocked
without the concurrence of every key&mdash;the keys in
the hands of a hundred different men, and they scattered to
a hundred and distant places; and they still stood musing
as to what invention, in all the dominions of mind and matter,
could be produced to make the impossibility of his escape
more complete than it was.<a name="FNanchor_332_340" id="FNanchor_332_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_340" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>Less than a decade of history proved Lincoln wiser than
those who framed the momentous majority opinion in the
Dred Scott case. Lincoln was learned not alone in legal
knowledge, but was also familiar with the mighty national
movements that laugh laws and decisions to scorn; that ultimately
and finally determine progress. These judges were
students of the past, slaves of precedent, defenders of antiquity,
while Lincoln was a student of the present and the
future and the ambassador of abiding justice. He had as
deep and ultimate a knowledge of the national character and
capacity as the statesman, and was a student of political
and social progress in order to follow and wisely lead the
deep public sentiment and conscience that alone measures
true civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN ILLINOIS</h3>


<p>Few pages in our history present a darker picture than
the ruffianism of the friends of slavery in Kansas, and
the retaliating spirit of its opponents. Still, the gloom is
illumined by patriotic politicians, democratic slave holders
and sympathizers, who sternly put duty before party. There
are few more glorious incidents in our political annals than
the unwavering fidelity of Robert J. Walker of Mississippi.
As Governor of Kansas he lived up to his public pledges,
though the offer of the Presidency of the United States was
dangled before him.<a name="FNanchor_333_341" id="FNanchor_333_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_341" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Like Washington, himself, Walker towered
above temptation. If the Mississippi statesman had
held the place of Buchanan, slavery, instead of being nursed
by the palsied policy of the Northern statesman, would have
been startled by another Jackson, and the nation might have
owed its salvation to a Southern leader instead of to the
prairie politician.</p>

<p>In the fine language of Seward: "The ghosts on the banks
of the Styx constitute a cloud scarcely more dense than the
spirits of the departed Governors of Kansas, wandering in
exile and sorrow for having certified the truth against falsehood
in regard to the elections between Freedom and Slavery
in Kansas."<a name="FNanchor_334_342" id="FNanchor_334_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_342" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The strange fact above all is that the admission
of Kansas as a slave state against the wishes of its
people was not asked for by the South. It was freely tendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to the slave dynasty by a majority of northern democrats
in the executive and legislative branches of the Government.<a name="FNanchor_335_343" id="FNanchor_335_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_343" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
And so again the North shared with the South
in the zeal for spreading slavery.</p>

<p>The final scene in the drama was the Lecompton Constitution.
Douglas then saw the fatal result that Lincoln had
foretold in his June speech of 1857, when he declared that
Douglas, since the famous Nebraska Bill, saw himself superseded
in a presidential nomination by one generally endorsing
his measure, but standing clear of the odium of its untimely
agitation and its violation of the national faith; that
he saw his chief aids in his own State, politically speaking,
successfully tried, convicted and executed for an offense not
their own, but his, and that now he saw his own case standing
next on the docket for trial.<a name="FNanchor_336_344" id="FNanchor_336_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_344" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Northern Democrats refused to brook longer the crime in
Kansas. To refuse submission of the Constitution to that
people made a mockery of the popular sovereignty of Douglas.
With desperate constancy he had impressed that great
principle, as he called it, on his constituency. It was now
so shorn of all dignity that even a child might see it. He
either had to lose Illinois or fight the policy of the administration.
Once having decided to differ he took a bold stand.
No Abolitionist or Republican used plainer or more impelling
language: "But if this Constitution is to be forced down
our throats, in violation of the fundamental principles of
free government, under a mode of submission that is a mockery
and insult, I will resist it to the last. I have no fear of
any party associations being severed. I should regret any
social or political estrangement, even temporarily; but if
it must be, if I cannot act with you and preserve my faith
and my honor, I will stand on the great principle of popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
sovereignty, which declares the right of all people to be left
perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions
in their own way. I will follow that principle wherever
its logical consequences may take me, and I will endeavor to
defend it against assault from any and all quarters. No
mortal man shall be responsible for my action but myself."<a name="FNanchor_337_345" id="FNanchor_337_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_345" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>The former distinction of Douglas as a slave advocate
made his seeming accession to the ranks of its opponents all
the more marked. Stirring stories were told of his peerless
courage when Buchanan told him to remember that no Democrat
ever yet differed from an administration of his own
choice without being crushed, and to beware of the fate of
Tallmadge and Rives.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," retorted Douglas, "I wish you to remember
that General Jackson is dead."<a name="FNanchor_338_346" id="FNanchor_338_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_346" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Like an undaunted
Abolitionist he flung aside all compromise, refused to accede
to the English bill that many administration opponents welcomed
as an exit from the dilemma of party recusancy. Many
began to believe that Douglas was about to turn into a black
Republican. He had stolen conferences with their leaders,
inducing them to believe that it was policy for him to conceal
his present real intention; that he would soon unmask
himself and fight their battles. He often said that he had
checked all his baggage and taken a through ticket.<a name="FNanchor_339_347" id="FNanchor_339_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_347" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>He convinced his foes that the Nebraska bill was a daring
device in behalf of freedom. One Republican said that the
plan of Douglas for destroying the Missouri line and thereby
opening the way for the march of freedom beyond the limits
forever prohibited and conceded to belong to the Slave
States, and its march westward, from the British possessions
to Mexico, struck him "as the most magnificent scheme ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
conceived by the human mind." This kind of conversation
made the deepest impression upon his hearers, and often
changed their opinion of the man.<a name="FNanchor_340_348" id="FNanchor_340_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_348" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>In this way, Douglas triumphantly vindicated his policy
of popular sovereignty for which he protested he was willing
to devote all his talent and the remainder of his life. The
very prospect of such a convert dazzled the vision of even
radicals like Greeley. So these visionaries wandered in the
dreamland of politics, and were eager to enter into an unholy
alliance. Even shrewd leaders in the party built bridges
for the entering of Douglas. It was rumored that Seward
and others were in the plot.<a name="FNanchor_341_349" id="FNanchor_341_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_349" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>A letter from Herndon in 1858 vividly shows the political
condition of this time. Speaking of Greeley he said, "He
evidently wants Douglas sustained and sent back to the
Senate. He did not say so in so many words, yet his <i>feelings</i>
are with Douglas. I <i>know</i> it from the spirit and drift
of his conversation. He talked bitterly&mdash;somewhat so&mdash;against
the papers in Illinois, and said they were fools. I
asked him this question, 'Greeley, do you want to see a third
party organized, or do you want Douglas to ride to power
through the North, which he has so much abused and betrayed?'
and to which he replied, 'Let the future alone; it
will all come right. Douglas is a brave man. Forget the
past and sustain the righteous.' Good God, <i>righteous</i>,
eh!... By-the-bye, Greeley remarked to me this, 'The Republican
standard is too high; we want something practical.'...
The Northern Men are cold to me&mdash;somewhat repellant."<a name="FNanchor_342_350" id="FNanchor_342_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_350" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Douglas, after a heroic combat with the administration
and after his triumphant championship of the rights of the
people of Kansas, returned as a conqueror to Illinois. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
was the ideal of the Democrats of his state, save of a few
office holders under Buchanan. With Lincoln it was otherwise.
Despite his brilliant and consecrated service to the
Republican principles, even in Illinois, in the home of his
friends, all was not yet serene; he was not yet to taste the
sweetness of hero worship. Too proud to resort to dramatic
effects, slow to express his resentment, he was almost jealous
of the supremacy of his rival. A veteran in the service of
freedom, he hardly welcomed the possible entrance of his old
foe into the Republican arena. Mingled with personal feeling,
was his knowledge of the crafty career of his opponent.
Lincoln was not content that Douglas should gain the laurel
of a triumphant movement in the hour of victory.</p>

<p>Not alone did Lincoln fear dissension in his own state,
but he was also afraid that Douglas might be taken up by
the Republican leaders of the party. He grew restless and
gloomy at the unjust attitude of Greeley, an attitude that
quite vanquished him. To Herndon he unburdened himself,
"I think Greeley is not doing me right. His conduct, I believe,
savors a little of injustice. I am a true Republican and
have been tried already in the hottest part of the anti-slavery
fight, and yet I find him taking up Douglas, a veritable
dodger,&mdash;once a tool of the South, now its enemy,&mdash;and
pushing him to the front. He forgets that when he does
that he pulls me down at the same time. I fear Greeley's
attitude will damage me with Sumner, Seward, Wilson, Phillips
and other friends in the East."<a name="FNanchor_343_351" id="FNanchor_343_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_351" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>He had slowly gained the confidence, more than he realized,
of the rank of his party. Though loyalty to him was less
pretentious, it was not the less sincere. The Republicans
in Illinois did not trust Douglas; they were not deceived
by his marvelous strategy. Pursuant to a wide spread sentiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the Republican state convention, with unanimity
adopted the significant resolution: "That Hon. Abraham
Lincoln is our first and only choice for United States Senator
to fill the vacancy about to be created by the expiration
of Mr. Douglas' term of office."<a name="FNanchor_344_352" id="FNanchor_344_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_352" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>One incident shows the enthusiasm of the hour. Cook
County brought a banner into the convention inscribed,
"Cook County for Abraham Lincoln." A delegate from another
county proposed to amend the banner by substituting
for "Cook County" the word "Illinois." "The Cook delegation
promptly accepted the amendment, and during a hurricane
of hurrahs, the banner was altered to express the
sentiment of the whole Republican party of the State."<a name="FNanchor_345_353" id="FNanchor_345_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_353" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE DAWN OF NATIONAL LEADERSHIP</h3>


<p>In anticipation of his nomination as Senator, Lincoln had
carefully prepared an address of acceptance. It was delivered
on the 17th of June, 1858, in the presence of an
immense audience at Springfield. At the time, it was perhaps
the most radical speech that had yet burst forth from
a Republican statesman. It is not strange that it astounded
his friends. It baffled their comprehension to find him at a
single stride in the front rank of the radicals. Herndon,
the aggressive abolitionist, was alike bewildered, saying of
the first paragraph that it was true; but asking if it was
entirely <i>politic</i> to read or speak it as it was written. Lincoln
said that it made no difference; that it was a truth of
all human experience; that he wanted to use some universally
known figure, expressed in simple language as universally
known that might strike home to the minds of men, in order
to rouse them to the peril of the times; that he would rather
be <i>defeated with that expression</i> in the speech, and have it
held up and discussed before the people, than to be <i>victorious
without it</i>.<a name="FNanchor_346_354" id="FNanchor_346_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_354" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Lamon questioned whether Lincoln had a clear right to
indulge in such a venture, as a representative party man in
a close contest, having other interests than his own in charge,
and bound to respect the opinions, and secure the success
of his party. Lamon states that at the Bloomington Convention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
he uttered the same ideas in almost the same words;
and their recognition of a state of incipient civil war in a
country for the most part profoundly peaceful,&mdash;these, and
the bloody work which might come of their acceptance by a
great party, had filled the minds of some of his hearers
with the most painful apprehensions; the theory was equally
shocking to them, whether as partisans or as patriots.
Begged to suppress such speech in the future, he vindicated
his utterance, but after much persuasion, promised at length
not to repeat it.<a name="FNanchor_347_355" id="FNanchor_347_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_355" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The night before its delivery, at a gathering of his close
friends, Lincoln slowly read the first paragraph. No uncertain,
unsparing criticisms followed. It was called "a fool
utterance," ahead of the time, a statement that would
frighten many voters.<a name="FNanchor_348_356" id="FNanchor_348_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_356" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Only one auditor, his partner, approved
the far-reaching statement, saying, "Lincoln, deliver
it just as it reads. It is in advance of the times, let us&mdash;you
and I, if no one else&mdash;lift the people to the level of
this speech now, higher hereafter. The speech is true, wise
and politic, and will succeed now or in the future. Nay, it
will aid you, if it will not make you President of the United
States."</p>

<p>Then Lincoln rose from his chair, walked backwards and
forwards in the hall, stopped and said that he had thought
about the matter a great deal, had weighed the question
from all corners, and was thoroughly convinced the time had
come when it should be uttered; and that if he must go down
because of that speech, he would go down linked to truth,
and would say again and again that the nation could not
live on injustice.<a name="FNanchor_349_357" id="FNanchor_349_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_357" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>This speech stands alone among American orations. Captivating
in its logic, marvellous in its directness, condensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in utterance, it is as true to Lincoln as the reply to Hayne
was to Webster. It is one of the most momentous addresses
in American history. It became the angry battle ground of
local and general campaigns. It directed the issues of national
parties. In a transitional period with the hand of
genius it peerlessly traced party demarcation lines. For the
moment in advance of the national progress it soon became
the very gospel of multitudes, the war cry of the friends of
the Union. Plainer to the average man than the fine phrase
of Seward as to "the irrepressible conflict," it brought home
to the daily worker the issues of the hour, put him face to
face with the deep meaning of the whole struggle going on
in his very presence. Its strength was in this&mdash;that it put
in clear speech the question that was agitating the common
mind and thus gave it form and being before other men.
With prophetic solemnity he indulged in the philosophic
utterance that the slavery agitation would not cease until a
crisis should be reached and passed, saying: "'A house divided
against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government
cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do
not expect the Union to be dissolved,&mdash;I do not expect the
house to fall; but I do expect that it will cease to be divided.
It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the
opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it,
and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief
that it is the course of ultimate distinction, or its advocates
will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all
the states,&mdash;old as well as new, North as well as South."<a name="FNanchor_350_358" id="FNanchor_350_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_358" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln in the loneliness of his soul passed upon the solemn
issue that the hour for speech and action had come; that
the time of compromise was over; that justice would no
longer be trifled with; that the law of humanity spurned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
further outrage. He gave voice to the hitherto silent sentiments
of many. The period for the judicious utterance of
radical truth had come. In a few years what then seemed
the outburst of a perverted attitude became the common
thought of the multitude.</p>

<p>And so again Lincoln showed his keen sense of the drift
of events. In this he was wiser than the pure politicians.
When events justified his foresight, some were found who
cherished the notion that Lincoln was guided by self-seeking
motives in his radical advocacy. Two biographers think that
Lincoln was quietly dreaming of the Presidency, and edging
himself to a place in advance, where the tide might take him
up in 1860; that as sectional animosities, far from subsiding,
were growing deeper and stronger with time, Lincoln knew
that the next nominee of the exclusively Northern party must
be a man of radical views, and so the speech was intended
to take the wind out of Seward's sails.<a name="FNanchor_351_359" id="FNanchor_351_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_359" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>The biographer who sees a plotting, scheming Lincoln
in all this is far from understanding the real man. For
mingled with his political sagacity was a sublime communion
with the mighty spirit of world justice. Elated at the approaching
clash of freedom and slavery, believing that out
of the conflict would come a better humanity, he rejoicingly
dwelt in the pure realm of the unfettered utterance of a
truth, far above the stifling valley of commonplace diplomacy.
To him it was a rare moment of utter freedom without
calculation, moving through regions of unclouded justice
and righteous outlook.</p>

<p>Criticism bitter and biting of political friends did not
shake his serenity or his belief in his diagnosis of the national
disease. He lived so long with the solution, that he showed
the calmness of a historian in judging passing events. Slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to value highly his own service, he was proudly aware of the
intrinsic worth of this utterance. To a friend who said
that the foolish speech would kill him, Lincoln replied that
if he had to draw a pen across, and erase his whole life from
existence, and he had one poor gift or choice left, as to what
he would save from the wreck, he would choose that speech,
and leave it to the world unerased.<a name="FNanchor_352_360" id="FNanchor_352_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_360" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Withal, the speech was wisely framed. It aroused the fear
of the Northerners with the statement that they would lie
down pleasantly dreaming that the people of Missouri were
on the verge of making their State free, and they would
awake to the reality instead that the Supreme Court had
made Illinois a slave state.<a name="FNanchor_353_361" id="FNanchor_353_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_361" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The dread that slavery might
invade the free States of the North, as it ceased to be something
more than a possibility, haunted and horrified the
North. Some who bore with complacency the servitude of the
black men in the distance fumed with anger as they contemplated
even a prospect of a closer relation of the institution.
Thus the self interest of the North was played upon.
This practical danger more than all abstract arguments
awakened free communities. Douglas saw the danger of this
appeal. He could no longer hold North and South. It put
him on the defensive. Lincoln forced the fighting. It became
necessary for Douglas to make the speech of Lincoln
the basis of his discussion.</p>

<p>Lincoln weighed his speech at its soul value, and measured
its truth and worth in lonely struggle. No counsel could
stay his purpose. He had come upon another crisis in his
career. He could no longer compromise with himself in
safety, the hour of decision could not be delayed. He faced
defeat in all its darkness but afar he saw the star of simple
duty. If he had faltered or cringed he might have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Senator, but that distinction only would have crowned him.
He had the rare perception of knowing when to be firm as
the earth beneath, of distinguishing between policy and principle,
of ever keeping his integrity unsullied by barter or bargain.
It is noteworthy that the very speech politicians
deemed the graveyard of his career in reality became his
apotheosis. The politician of Illinois became a national
leader. From that time, he loomed large in the history of
the Republican party and was regarded as wise in counsel
and brave in speech. Before Seward, he put in concrete
utterance the very philosophy of Republicanism. And that
party had reason to regard him with favor as a possible
guide in the gathering contest.</p>

<p>This speech gave Lincoln a prominence that led to the
dramatic debates with Douglas and that fastened the attention
of the nation on the combat. The Lincoln-Douglas
controversy was the fruition of this Springfield speech. This
address is the most fitting line of demarcation between Lincoln
the Citizen of Illinois and Lincoln the Citizen of the
United States.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h3>


<p>The political condition of a nation is a symptom of its
health or disease. Official corruption is an unfailing
sign of national degeneration. Art, science and commerce
may thrive, yet if dishonesty and selfishness rule in the administration
of public affairs, there is no substantial
progress. The real civilization of a nation can advance little
beyond the state of public service. When citizens are indifferent
to the general welfare, when the rights of the many
are entrusted to the designing, when talent is dedicated to
the acquisition of wealth or the mere promotion of art, then
in spite of mountain high learning and world wide commercial
prosperity, a nation is in the domain of danger.</p>

<p>A crisis reveals the potency of the politician and statesman.
When war or internal conflict shows its "wrinkled
front," then the merchant, the manufacturer, the artist, and
the scientist forget their pride. The true politician is the
incarnation of civil patriotism and guards the nation during
the long days of peace, with an unfailing heroism like that
of the soldier in the sudden test of war. The devotion of
the civil hero is not spectacular and is often undervalued.
The whole history of humanity has been a giant effort to
beget a democracy where the genius of the few shall become
the possession of many. When a nation cannot command
the best heart and brain of its citizens for its service it is
bankrupt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>The problem of Democratic government is the maintenance
of a just balance between the radical and conservative elements
of society, between anarchy and apathy. American
history was for a long time largely a struggle between visionary
abolitionist and slavery adherent. Northern reformers
turned all Southerners into vigorous advocates of human
bondage, while Southern radicals finally abolitionized the
North. Slaveholders were the children of a long established
selfish interest. Abolitionists were possessed of a
vision. Neither understood the other. Rock and cloud were
not more unlike. Each saw only the injustice in the opposing
position, and had no charity for the environment and
traditions of the other. There could be no compromise between
a Wendell Phillips and a Preston Brooks. War was
the only solution.</p>

<p>Statesmanship looks to the preservation of the primal principles
of the Republic, favors the general welfare whenever
circumstances permit, seeks its progressive evolution, encourages
prudent reform, a reform that is not the parent of
reaction. It avoids alike the radicalism of the demagogue
and the stagnation of the materialist. While stupid conservatism
is unwittingly the main friend of anarchy, statesmanship
is its chief foe. The stability of the Republic depends
on wise leadership, courageous enough to combat violence
on the one hand and greed on the other.</p>

<p>Egoism and foolish fears are the chief obstacles of human
progress. Self interest being the main source of human action,
it is the problem of the politician to quicken the public
conscience and convince the community that advancement
and enlightened selfishness are companions. Altruism is a
large factor in human evolution, yet not so basic that it may
be made the foundation of abiding government. It is a high
mission to lead the people to the conception of making self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
interest an every day servant of the general welfare.</p>

<p>Expediency is as essential to the triumph of right as to
that of wrong. Cunning materialism may vanquish virtue
that is a stranger to wisdom, but prudent integrity never
knows final defeat. The following of visions without purpose
is as vain as the worship of debasing worldliness. Politics
is a larger phase of life than the idealist comprehends, while
ideas are more dominant than politicians dream.</p>

<p>In an ideal state diplomats would be no more essential
than the physician, lawyer, jurist and minister. Compromise
finds its basis in human weakness, conservatism and
selfishness. The history of humanity is written in blood
and tears largely because men have been prone to passion
and prejudice rather than true to reason and judgment.
Politics is the art of securing results in government. It is
a study of success applied to legislation and administration.</p>

<p>There are few problems of larger moment than the general
acceptance of the wisest policy in combating established
and organized evil. Civilization itself depends on the manner
in which the unresting battle between the constructive
and destructive forces in society is conducted and decided.
Mighty empires have flourished and fallen, democracies have
sprung to life and decayed, dauntless protesters have sacrificed
on the altar of conviction, even nations under the
spirit of high impulses have for a short time followed the
banner of the brotherhood of man. Yet in spite of ages
of progress, of heroic martyrdom, the battle is still of the
same character as the conflict was on the plains of Palestine,
the banks of the Nile and the seven hills of Rome. Human
nature has changed largely in outer manifestations, not in
essential character. The selfishness of man, vested interests,
fear of change, still stand in the way of righteous reforms,
which are now as bitterly contested as they were by the patricians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of Latium and the barons of the middle ages. In the
conflicts of centuries good men have sunk sometimes in a
fearless, sometimes in an imprudent encounter with the host
of cohesive and malignant interests. Selfish motives unite
the supporters of evil, while the forces of righteousness are
often discordant and rent with civil feuds. Economic interest
is the influence that makes evil gregarious.</p>

<p>Lincoln conceived his plan of warfare on the organized
evil of his time in wisdom. He attacked it at its weakest
point, its injustice and its bad policy. He made it not only
an ethical issue, but an economic one as well. He understood
that reform must be founded on self interest as well
as on justice. He fought the evil and not the wrong doer.
He was aware of the influence of environment on the opinions
of men whenever property rights were involved and so
would not exact nor expect too much of the individual. He
did not favor premature reform, knowing that it was not
permanent. A foe to slavery, yet for a long time he was
not a friend of abolitionism. He longed for the emancipation
of the black man, yet would not buy it by attacks on
the Constitution or on the compromises of the statesmen
of the Republic.</p>

<p>He admitted the evil of slavery, yet recognized the institution
as far as the law sanctioned its existence. So he would
fight its transfer to new territory where it had no legal right
of entrance. He would circumscribe and starve it, would
favor compensated emancipation, and thus slowly and safely
eradicate the evil from the nation. His political philosophy
is worthy of the study of every citizen, patriot and reformer,
of every man who believes in the dawn of better ages. His
greatness consists in never having relinquished his lofty ideal
in all of the materialism of daily compromise, and in never
forgetting charity, justice and policy in his communion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
world-shaking ideas.</p>

<p>No man in history longed for the triumph of justice more
earnestly than Abraham Lincoln. He hated evil. Still his
main purpose was the preservation of the principles of the
republic. Rather than endanger them, the larger good, he
would hesitate to begin a campaign against organized selfishness.
Such battles for humanity require good generalship
as well as those of cannon, fife and drum. It is not enough to
hate evil, to strike at it in the dark. To husband strength,
to bide the time, to await the solemn moment for attack, is
political generalship, a generalship that is as essential in
the Senate as on the battlefield.</p>

<p>He was willing to engage in the hard mission of educating
men to believe that brotherhood was a more substantial foundation
for humanity than hatred and selfishness. There
was nothing of Don Quixote in his warfare. Democracy was
his religion, the source of his strength and the secret of his
influence. All that he was, he largely owed to the privileges
of the Republic, to the support of the plain people. He believed
in them with a rare faith and they trusted him with
remarkable fidelity, as the incarnation of the higher humanity.
He was in harmony with the onward movement of
sanity, justice and manhood. Charity to all was his platform,
justice his program, democracy his guide. His spirit
is the spirit of the new age. He almost marks as distinguished
an advance in American history as Moses did in that
of Israel.</p>

<p>The politician blindly follows, while the statesman wisely
educates public sentiment. In his political philosophy Lincoln
gave due weight to the potency of the general opinion
of mankind. He said, "He who molds public sentiment goes
deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions.
He makes statutes or decisions possible or impossible to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
executed." He well knew the principle, so paltrily recognized,
by even modern legislators, that it is far more vital
to prepare the public mind for righteous legislation than
prematurely to pass laws. It would be well to write his
supreme statement relating to public sentiment in every
legislative hall and judicial tribunal in the whole land. An
educated public sentiment will soon enough secure the passage
of appropriate legislation, and what is more essential,
see to it that it is enforced. The curse of American politics
is the passage of multitudinous enactments to please certain
organized interests and the deliberate indifference, if not hostility,
of public sentiment to their subsequent enforcement.
The problem will be far from settled until fewer laws are
passed, and such enactments are religiously enforced. Lincoln
would not aid in the passage of a law not intended to
be enforced or incapable in the common course of events of
being substantially enforced, and he recognized that legislation
should be a practical science based on the actual
character, the ability of a people to move forward. Froward
reform is almost as pernicious as selfish conservatism.</p>

<p>So complete was Lincoln's mastery over the masses that
many have misunderstood the power of his genius as merely
following public opinion. He did infinitely more. He studied
the capacity of men for progress, slowly leading them to the
higher altitude. Lincoln recognized the limitations of average
human advance; that the mind and heart move slowly in
the march of centuries. He worked with the materials at
hand and builded on the solid foundation of the real national
character. He did not stand in the direct way of events,
still he deemed it a duty ever to guide them toward the goal
of an advancing civilization.</p>

<p>The attitude of Lincoln to party organization is of commanding
interest. There was no more valiant, earnest worker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in the Whig ranks. None can question his devotion to the
routine, burdensome labor of the campaign. In making
speeches, in writing platforms, in arranging meetings, in issuing
circulars, and in the tiring work at the polls, he was
a persistent toiler, a loyal partisan. In the Legislature he
usually voted with his associates. He often sought to
strengthen the party in the selection of office holders.</p>

<p>He believed in organized political action. He remained
a trusted leader in the party of his choice, seldom alienating
himself from the party managers, or the rank and file. Still
he was no slave of party or caucus. His party, town or
state, could not buy or bribe his integrity, or get him to be
false to his duty. He believed that parties were useful to
democratic government as long as they were substantially in
harmony with its deeper objects. Still he did not deem them
sacred, and when circumstances demanded, favored their dissolution,
and the organization of new parties. He was one
of the few politicians in American history who acted on the
conviction that the man who served his state best, best
served his party. Having no sympathy with anarchy in politics,
he gave full value to the importance of the organization,
but did not exalt it into an object of adoration. Above
it, he placed loyalty to the Constitution and the fathers of
the country. He was neither mugwump nor partisan.</p>

<p>There are two classes of men, materialists and visionaries.
The materialist is a slave to the fact. He is so intent on
the earth that he seldom enjoys a glimpse of star or constellation.
Still he is a student of methods and results, a
worshipper of success, and hence he is generally in the ascendancy.
The visionary is a slave to his ideal, he looks at the
world as it should be and not as it is. While he gazes at
the sunset and the evening star he falls in the pit at his
feet. He resembles the mariner of Heine:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
"A wonderful lovely maiden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sits high in her glory there,</span><br />
Her robe with gems is laden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she combeth her golden hair,</span><br />
And as she combs it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gold comb glistens,</span><br />
The while she is singing a song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hath a mystical sound and a wonderful melody,</span><br />
The boatman when once she has bound him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is lost in wild mad love,</span><br />
He sees not the black rocks around him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sees but the beauty above."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The real leaders in the world's history have been idealists
of high practical wisdom. They have been the captains, not
the subjects of their ideal. The petty politician rules for
the day. The men who dominate the ages give substance to
shadow, make the dream of one day the reality of another,
crystallize the yearnings of humanity into statute and decision.</p>

<p>The world is used to the omnipresent politician. The
visionary, the undaunted reformer, is not an infrequent participant
in the domain of affairs. The political idealist, with
the judgment of the one and the inspiration of the other, is
so rare that he confounds by his presence. The combination
astounds the generation unaccustomed to such a phenomenon.
The man of high endowments is stupidly expected to be wanting
in worldliness, and the practical representative of the
people in the vision. The solution of all political problems
depends on political sagacity illumined with altruism. The
political idealist consummates the alliance of vision with
method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>Lincoln was neither idealist nor politician. With the idealist
he was faithful to the vision, with the politician he studied
the way to success. He was not lost in mere adoration of
the ideal; was not content until it became a reality. He
blended the enthusiasm of the visionary with the wisdom of
the politician. He was the ideal politician.</p>

<p>Lincoln was the prophet politician of his time, blending
the righteousness of the Hebraic seer with political sagacity.
He faced failure imperiously. He was never finally vanquished.
He looked beyond temporary triumph to ultimate
consequences. Despite setback, disaster and every obstacle,
he had abounding faith in the abiding triumph of justice.</p>

<p>He knew the shortcomings of human nature, the painful,
sluggard progress of moral evolution. He weighed men as
they were and not as he wished them to be. Hence, he was
patient with their failings. He made ample allowance for
the heavy hand of habit, for ancestral, religious, political,
social and industrial environment. That men were largely
the children of their time was to him an ever present truth.
Coperation not antagonism was his method of achievement.
He would not force progress and he recognized the sway of
the grim law of necessity. He measured the labored march
of public sentiment. He waited the slow processes of time;
was no believer in magical reforms or quack political remedies.
He did not squander his energies in the wonderland
of dreams. He is the wisest politician in American history,
consummate in his strategy for the general welfare, the supreme
friend and champion of democracy and humanity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
